Car parking at Lands End can be expensive at some times of the year. Ten minutes walk from Lands End, at the junction of the A30 &amp; B3315 there is parking for a few cars.

Lands end to John O’Groats Race between Mr Cool and Clever Clogs (two travel bugs)

Mr Cool began his race on 18 August 2002. Hopefully on his way he will collect a lot of wonderful poems, stories and drawings. When he gets to his destination we will post this information on this cache page.</groundspeak:long_description>

Close to a free National Trust Car Park &amp;amp; attraction - the

in winter - in fact all year - wrap the kids up warm - there are
some drops so keep small children close. Some glass has been

now made this a CITO cache - Following all the no finds I did

The co-ordinates are for the tunnel entrance, your GPS will not work inside the tunnel (obvious but relevant)
The tunnel is disused, so no trains coming.

The tunnel can be slippy, be careful.
The disused tracks are the best way to travel through the tunnel.
There a a number of open access chambers to the side of the tracks, these could be dangerous.
The cache is located near too the roof ventilation shaft situated approximately halfway along the tunnel.
Easiest access to the railway tracks can be made at the rear of Silverdale Church.</groundspeak:long_description>

We tried to hide it the opposite end of the area from the existing micro cache to make it a nice circular walk. Those that are eagle eyed will see the lid of the cache says Cocknage Booty - as this was meant for Cocknage but its too muddy up there at the moment- thats for later????
Best to park near the visitors centre and walk from there - hope the co-ordinates are ok?

We've been out today and managed to retrieve the cache from its original but broken place. Its extremely dangerous as others have noticed to attempt to get to the cache from where it was, without the mechanism. I've moved the cache into a ground level location near to the original co-ordinates. This will allow people to still locate it and log it. I don't want to see this cache archived as its in quite the good location. If the current owner no longer wishes to maintain it, I'll take it on as one of my own.

We also added some more bits and bobs to it and also left a trackable too.]

A hint for the new location: Its in an old stump at ground level, look for a purple lid. Its not far from the path you've walked up.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The Hidden Moorlands series consists of seven geocaches hidden
around the Staffordshire Moorlands. This series will introduce the
geocacher to some of the less well-known beauty spots of the
district. The cache is located adjacent to a footpath between Leek
Road and Roughcote, in a locality known as Sheepwash. Despite being
only a few miles from the urban sprawl of The Potteries, this is a
pleasant area of meadows and woodland.</groundspeak:short_description>

Ross Bridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Recommended parking is at the end of the no-through-road at
Sheepwash. Head over the ford and park alongside the pumping
station. Please park sensibly and don't block the lane. From here,
follow the footpath in a westerly direction across the meadows
towards the cache. There are alternative routes to the cache.
However, I wouldn't recommend using the path from Roughcote after
rain - it can turn in to an absolute mudbath! You have been warned!</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The cache is hidden at the foot of a sapling, on the bank just off the footpath.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In 1918, Mrs Florence Carr, who lived in Villiers Street Dresden and whose husband had died of wounds, decided that some form of remembrance was needed for all those who had died and suffered in the service of their country. Over a long period of time she made strenuous efforts to community leaders for a suitable memorial to be built. Eventually, lorry loads of materials, including Hollington stone were tipped onto a small field were the Cenotaph now stands.  Mrs Carr conducted her own little services on Remembrance Sundays by placing poppies on the stones which we were strewn about with the word  ‘These stones represent the men who sacrificed their lives for our country ‘
 Eventually stonemasons arrived on the site to dress the stone into the Cenotaph that we know today. 
In 1976, this haven of remembrance was vandalised, although the building itself was untouched , 17 brass plaques containing the names of local heroes was stolen, only 3 plaques were ever recovered and the thieves never found.  
A committee was set up which campaigned for refurbish the Cenotaph and eventually work began in 1993. By 2001 the committee had raised enough money to replace all the plaques that are now responded in black, with gold etching and included 2 extra plaques to which a further 50 names have been added .

Master Potter – Josiah Spode

Leading to Master Potter – The Kiln

Thomas Minton (1765 – 1836) was an English potter. He founded Thomas Minton &amp; Sons in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, which grew into a major ceramic manufacturing company with an international reputation.

He established his pottery factory in Stoke-upon-Trent in 1793 producing earthenware and from 1798 bone china. His products were mostly standard domestic tableware in blue transfer printed or painted earthenware and china, including the ever-popular willow pattern, plus from 1820 fine ornamental chinaware.

The co ordinates listed are for the Minton family vault.
The question you need to solve to find the cache is:

XY = Thomas Minton’s grandson, Colin Herbert Campbell, died in 19XY

Master Potter – Henry Doulton
Master Potter – Thomas Minton 
Master Potter – Josiah Wedgwood
Master Potter – Josiah Spode

Leading to Master Potter – The Kiln

Josiah Wedgwood - July 12, 1730 - January 3, 1795, born Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent was an English potter, credited with the industrialization of the manufacture of pottery. He was a member of the Darwin — Wedgwood family, most famously including his grandson, Charles Darwin.

Wedgwood's work was of very high quality (when visiting his workshop, if he saw an offending vessel that failed to meet with his standards, he would smash it with his stick, exclaiming, "This will not do for Josiah Wedgwood!"). Wedgwood was also keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish Josiah's wares from anything else on the market.

The co ordinates listed are for the Wedgwood family memorial tablet.

To find the co ordinates to the final cache you need to go to the co ordinates listed. 

Stand so you can read the plaque, then look over your right shoulder to the railed in wall. Walk over to the plaque in this wall (the original alter) and count the number of letters on the plaque. This equals PQ.

Lane. There is a few places to pull in, but please ensure you find
a safe spot to do so if you are planning to do this one as a "cache
and dash". Otherwise it can be found whilst discovering the many
other caches along this canal network. We do a circular walk
between our other 2 caches most evenings: &lt;a href=

Cache of the Beast.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;
We are currently experimenting with a new kind of "environmentally
friendly" cache container. If anyone would like one - they come in
three sizes - they are completely free of charge and are made from
100% recycled plastic, and when they are done with, can be recycled
again!This is the middle size. You can get a micro logbook in there
and perhaps a pin badge and a geocoin?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This area is popular with muggles. Be on the lookout! Also I think
you probably have to be at least 5 feet tall to reach this one.

Because the ground can be marshy in places, wellies are recommended, with waterproof boots a minimum requirement. Also, if you are accompanied by dogs or small children, take care near the drainage ditches which cross the area.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is a regular click-lock plastic container placed inside a camo bag.

 &lt;br /&gt;
Don't be Discouraged, Heartbreak hill doesn't refer to steep climb
but is a nickname given to the cheshire locks by boaters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartbreak hill is a flight of 26 locks spread out over 7 miles
dropping the canal from harecastle tunnel and the summit of the
canal onto the cheshire plain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The locks were opened in 1777, but the traffic using the canal
got so great that the canal company appointed the engineer Thomas
Telford to improve the navigation in 1830, an additional tunnel at
harecastle was built and all the 26 locks of the cheshire locks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church Locks 47 and 48 were duplicated but now both duplicate
locks are out of use.&lt;br /&gt;
Though in the 18 years i have been on the canal the higher lock,
47, hasn't been in use, and the lock wall has bowed considerably
and is supported by props across the chamber.&lt;br /&gt;
 The lower duplicate lock, 48, has only been taken out of use in
the last 3 years, I suspect to conserve water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound above the locks is another of our favourite spots to
tie up after a hard days work up the locks from middlewich. By the
time we tie up, I will probably have walked 10 miles along the
towpath working the locks, whilst Cath steers the boat, she does
her fair share of locking as well, before you feel sorry for
me.&lt;/p&gt;
Also at the locks is one of the T&amp;amp;M mileposts, these are read
in the direction you are travelling and not as a finger post, so
Shardlow is up the locks, so you read the distance to go as you
approach the milepost, a bit odd but you get used to it. Shardlow
is the point where the canal joins the Trent and Preston Brook the
point where the canal ends and joins the Bridgewater canal

Heartbreak hill is a flight of 26 locks spread out over 7 miles
dropping the canal from harecastle tunnel and the summit of the
canal onto the cheshire plain.&lt;br /&gt;
The locks were opened in 1777, but the traffic using the canal got
so great that the canal company appointed the engineer Thomas
Telford to improve the navigation in 1830, an additional tunnel at
harecastle was built and all the 26 locks of the cheshire locks
were reccomended to be duplicated, 24 of them were completed before
money ran out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f78c1f35-eb55-455b-a686-d22a197de46a.jpg" /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;The Top lock, No 41, of the cheshire locks are located in
Kidsgrove, next to Harding wood junction with the Macclesfield
canal which heads off southwards?!?,( Macclesfield being to the
north at this point), it crosses the main line of the canal further
down the flight, a canal slip road!!&lt;br /&gt;
The real reason for this unusual arrangement was that the
macclesfield canal was built 30 years later than the T&amp;amp;M and
the T&amp;amp;M insisted that the water from the new canal should enter
at the summit level therby improving the water supply to the
T&amp;amp;M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of the duplicated locks are in use and they speed up the
passage of boats greatly, especially after a convoy of boats comes
out of the harecastle tunnel. The locks are very busy as the boats
start their descent to the cheshire plain.&lt;/p&gt;

Pool Aqueduct carries the macclesfield canal across the trent and
mersey canal below the tail of pool lock No.42. The maccelsfield
canal joins the T&amp;amp;M at hardings wood junction on the summit
pound of the T&amp;amp;M further up the flight of locks. This is one of
the rare times when a canal crosses a canal.&lt;br /&gt;

 The Aqueduct is a very sturdy structure that seems weighed down by
its responsibility. Climb the steps to get a good view of the
T&amp;amp;M and the duplicated locks.

Red Bull locks form the top 6 locks of the cheshire locks, No.s
41-46 and drop the canal down 55ft from the summit pound and pass
the pub 'The Red Bull' which gives the flight its name, all 6 locks
were duplicated but the lock outside the red bull is now singled
and the old lock now serves as a beer garden ( not a bad reuse, in
my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;
The lower 3 locks pass through pasture fields and are accompanied
by the Kidsgrove to Crewe electrified railway. This section of the
flight is very visually pleasing and a pleasure to work
through.&lt;br /&gt;

this will be a bit harder than my other caches but I hope you prove

Please ensure its well hidden it looks quiet but its well visited
by kids (as all the names engraved in the sand stone testify)

 You do NOT need to climb down the canyon wall. Or enter through

There's plenty of on-street parking within 100 yards of GZ, but the path you'll have to take is steep so wheelchairs may struggle.  The path is very quiet, but there's a chance of muggle kids playing in a nearby wooded area - keep it stealthy!</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Brown ammo tin.  This is an ideal location to trade larger trackables, and we're starting a big one of our own on it's journey from here.  Please try to leave a trackable if you are taking one, so that the cache always contains some for trade.

5th June 2010 - we've just found an old polaroid camera.  We've put this in to the cache - this is not for trade but ideally we'd like all cachers who find it, to smile and take their photo for us.  We'll upload all images periodically :), please let us know when the film runs out.

Drivers: please do not park in "The Villas".  This is a private road, and there's no easy way through to the cache from here.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">A true Potteries son, Arnold Bennett was born in “Hanbridge”, as it was known in his novels, in 1867. His father was a solicitor but Arnold left the practice to become a full time journalist after winning a competition in “Titbits”. His first novel “The man from the North” was published in 1898 and in 1900 he devoted himself to writing full time. His out put was prodigious but he is best known for his series of novels set in the Potteries beginning with “Anna of the Five Towns”. His novel “Clayhanger” was serialised for TV.

Will may not have visited the Potteries but that didn’t stop the city commemorating him in this lofty manner.
Baptised in 1564 (no one knows when he was born exactly) he is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and is often known simply as “the Bard”.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The father of science fiction (alongside Jules Verne) and also the father of miniature war gaming, Herbert George Wells was a prolific writer in many genres. The son of an ex-gardener turned shopkeeper, who sold china and sporting goods he was an outspoken socialist and pacifist. After a failed apprenticeship as a draper he finally got into the Normal School of science (later the Royal college of science) where he edited the science journal. Around this time he started writing. His many works include such perennial classics as “The Time Machine”, “The war of the worlds” and “The invisible man”. In his preface to the 1941 edition of “The war in the air”, Wells stated that his epitaph should be: "I told you so. You damned fools!"
At some point in his tumultuous life he managed to stay in Stoke-on-Trent.

Although JRR himself is more connected with Birmingham and Oxford, His son John Francis Reuel Tolkien was priest-in-charge at the Church of Our Lady of the Angels and St Peter in Chains, in Hartshill until his death in 2003.

The fountain was erected in 1898 at the top of Leek Road to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. It was demolished in the 1930s, apart from an inscribed stone which survives as the base of a seat.

This is an extremely busy area, so please be careful next to the road, especially if you have children. There is parking all the way down Station road, which is also ideal parking for our three other caches in the area. This could be done as a cache and dash, but please park sensibly. The cache is small, and you would be advised to bring your own writing implement. It may fit a geocoin in, but not a heavy one.

This cache is wheelchair accessible, only if replaced in reach of someone in a wheelchair. Please keep this in mind. We will check on this often.

Muzio Clementi was born in Rome, Italy in 1752, but spent most of his life living in England. He is most famous for his collection of  piano sonatina’s and sonata’s. Well worth a listen.

The cache is a small container, which holds a few swaps, a log book and a pencil.

The Stoke-on-Trent National Garden Festival&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; was the second
of Britain's National Garden Festivals. It was held in the city
from 1 May to 26 October 1986, and involved the reclamation of one
half of the site of the Shelton Bar steelworks (1830-1978), about
two miles north-west of the city centre, between Hanley and
Burslem. The other half of the area remained a working site for
British Steel's Shelton Bar steel rolling mill, finally closing in
2000.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How to find this geocache&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find this cache, you need to find two numbers. These numbers are
required to find the co-ordinates of the tiny cache hidden
somewhere in the area. The walking distance to complete this cache
is minimal (approx 1km from car to car). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STAGE 1 - N53° 01.712 W002° 11.688&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Count the number of stones in this ring of stones. If you are
feeling lazy, this can be done from home using GoogleEarth. Do NOT
count the stones on the grass. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This single digit number is &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STAGE 2 - N53° 01.871 W002° 11.761&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Look for a laminated number in full view. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This single digit number is &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CACHE Co-ordinates -&lt;/b&gt; The cache can be found at the following
co-ordinates:-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;N53° 01.9BA W002° 11.A92&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PLEASE HIDE THE CACHE AS YOU FIND IT.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First to find = &lt;b&gt;YOU?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;By viewing, searching for and/or finding this cache you assume
all responsibility for yourself, your party members and all
possessions. TAKE CARE NEAR WATER. We have placed this cache in
good faith, please enjoy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If travelling by car, park at Students' Union (P&amp;amp;D during
office hours). Head towards the hall of residence that shares a
girls name. Do not be afraid to follow your instincts/GPSr even if
it is seemingly telling you to walk off a well established tarmac
path into the bushes! All will become clear! This is a rare
opportunity to wander into one of the less well known aspects of
Keele.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Advisable to attempt this only in the day to be sure no muggles are
partying nearby. Also good shoes are recommended as the area can
get slippery and muddy underfoot at times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are searching for a small lunchbox which contains a pen, log,
and a few swaps.&lt;br /&gt;

Many [b][red]daughter[/b][/red] caches have been born as a direct result but so far only one [b][blue]Son[/b][/blue]!
We have therefore decided to redress the balance and we are glad to announce the arrival of another [b][blue]Son[/b][/blue].
He is placed on a public footpath somewhere in Keele Village.

Some wiki info about Keele University can be found here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keele_University



It's a simple [b]University Challenge[/b] to work out the co-ords.

So here's your starter for ten, no conferring!

[b]Q.1. In what year did Keele University become Champions of University Challenge[/b] [?]  

[blue]Answer[/blue]   =  [b] 19AB [/b]

Got it [?] Good.  15 bonus points if you can answer these next three questions.

[b]Q.2. What was the all-time lowest score achieved [/b](if that's the word)[b] by Sussex University in 1971[/b]

[blue]Answer[/blue] = [b]CD[/b]  

[b]Q.3. The highest match score of all time was University College, Oxford's [?][?][?] points in 1987, versus Reading.[/b]

[blue]Answer[/blue] = [b]EFG[/b]

[b]Q.4. "If A stands for Artichoke, B for Because, C for Curriculum, and D for Do, what might E be for".[/b][?] 

[blue]Answer[/blue] = _________________



The cache can be found at [b]N 53° 00.(A-F)C(A-E) W 002° 17.(E+G)D(B-C) [/b]



Here's a little game to play whilst googling the answer [;)] http://www.mousebreaker.com/games/universallychallenged/playgame

Please be aware when retrieving the cache for [b]universally challenged muggles[/b] 

It's not compulsary, but if you start your on-line log entry with your answer to question four and end it with a vote for your favourite "[b][red]Inquizitor[/b][/red]" either [b][green]Bamber[/b][/green] or [b][blue]Jeremy[/b][/blue] you'll get a bonus point. [:D]

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">After a long weekend in Cornwall in our VW George decided to  breakdown, thankfully it was at the services.
We had a bit of a wait for the Fourth Emergency Services and then for the minibus to take all 7 of us home.
What better way to spend the wait  than to plant our first geocache?
Our Australian relatives who were with us found it all highly amusing and have promised to start caching once they get back to sunny Brisbane.
We improvised with materials we had to hand:An empty soap bubble bottle,the plastic cover from spectacles lens spray ( to keep the log dry  ) and the log is made up of the back of a cheque book.Sorry ,no pen.
RNLI trolley coin from St Ives Lifeboat for FTF.

("broken as... "is the Australian/Kiwi way of expressing a superlative,any adjective lends itself to this phrase)

Strensham Services felt like a very long way from home,however it is apparently( in daylight) only 29 miles from home so maintaining the cache won't be a problem.
Well,we are happy to hear that George will be fine with a new gearbox/flywheel/bottom end.

"stay on or get off .. stay on or getoff???" then you end up contemplating so much that you miss the slip road and have to stay on, sometimes for hours! *yaaawn*

Now - with living in S-o-T i know how long and boring J15 - J16 is (and vice versa) and there can be so many traffic jams! might be nothing but then you get the crane necks gawping at nothing and slowing everybody down (we all do it!)

So if you fancy like slipping off at one of these junctions and heading on down (or up) the A500, then you will be pleased to know that I have put out a series of 10 caches along the A500 to keep you amused while you sneak ahead of all the traffic on the motorway and jump ahead a junction.

Caches numbered 1 - 8 are meant to be nice quick and easy cache and dashes, a couple you barely even have to step a foot out of the car! (thats if you park in the right place heehee) They are either 35mm Canisters or click and lock boxes for swaps.

Caches number 9 and 10 are the BONUS caches!! There is 1 placed North and 1 placed South close to the Juntion slip road. To get the actual co-ords for these you need to collect ALL of the other caches numbered 1 - 8. Inside each one, written somewhere on the log there is a letter and a number (eg A=9) collect all of these and get the BONUS cache before you join the motorway again. EASY!!

NOW - the fun part is ... instead of your boring old usual geoswag in the bonus caches, I have placed a PRIZE for the FTF - a cool prize and a booby prize heehee - in one there is a poor little badge, in the other I have placed a memory stick that I have never used patiently waiting inside its gift box for someone to collect it --- BUT which bonus cache is it in? who knows!!! I made them look the same, filled them up - then got Lindiloo to mingle them round ... i have nooo idea :o)

SO - what you waiting for? Take the next slip road and get hunting! The caches will take you off the A500 briefly but all you need to do then is get back on again - all the caches are close to the A500 so you wont have to go far from it. For the little geocachers in the car there might be some fun stuff to do on the way if the grown ups will let you out of the car for a bit of a break before joining the motorway again!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All caches have been placed in good faith, please take care when you park and put your safety first at all times.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Potteries Museum and Art Gallery contains displays and exhibitions about the rich history of our region. You can see the world’s greatest collection of Staffordshire ceramics, Reginald Mitchell’s World War 2 Spitfire, preserved animals, traditional shop displays, changing art exhibitions and more. 

Admission is free and the Museum is open every day.
Mar – Oct: Mon - Sat 10am – 5pm, Sun 2 – 5pm
Nov – Feb: Mon – Sat 10am – 4pm, Sun 1 – 4pm

For more information visit the website www.stoke.gov.uk/museum

The geocache is a small size plastic box with a log book and a few items to swap. You will need to find it during normal museum opening hours and it is in an area accessible to the public. When searching be careful not to disturb the hiding place. You won’t need to touch any museum exhibits and please leave everything as you found it.
You might notice something strange about the GPS coordinates as you approach the main entrance but keep following this direction. You won't be able to get a signal when inside the building. Or will you?</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">My First Cache! A total route of around 3.6km. Much of the initial 2.4km trail is on the flat although some parts will not be suitable for wheelchairs. A torch may prove useful on dull days. Some parts of the tour have thick tree cover in the summer which may cause you to search for a good GPS signal. The final cache is a 1.2km round trip and will involve a gentle climb, crossing styles and possible encounters with livestock.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a multiple tour around the 7th Century town of Eccleshall – Eccleshall lies in the Sow valley in one of the most picturesque areas of Staffordshire. For many centuries it was the market town for a large agricultural area and the country home of the Bishops of Lichfield. In the 19th Century it became even more prosperous as an important staging post for coaching traffic on the London to Chester route. This accounts for the high number of Pubs and Inns once reaching a total of 12 of which only 7 remain today. The many and varied shops in the town still cater for the needs of residents and visitors alike. 
Housing developments in recent years have helped to maintain the town’s vibrant community. Eccleshall is a well preserved market town with a large number of listed and architecturally significant buildings in the High Street. It is easily accessible and yet retains a charm that many other small towns have lost.

The original Cache Contents include:
First, Second and Third To Find Certificates which carry a bonus in a certain traders premises in Eccleshall - Details on the certificates.
Lots of Geocoins and Travel Bugs (Including my first two TB's)
Some DVD's
Other miscellaneous goodies

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Etruria Industrial museum is a scheduled ancient monument as it is the last working steam-powered potters' mill in Britain. 

The mill was built in 1857 to grind materials needed for the pottery industry. These included flint and cattle bone - yes, bone china really does have bones in it! If you visit on a steaming weekend you can see the mill in action as the steam engine 'Princess' powers the mill machinery. Steaming dates are usually the first weekend of the month but check the website for details. 
www.stoke.gov.uk/museum 

The Museum is open April to November
Wednesday - Sunday 12 - 4:30pm
Adults £2.50, Concessions £1.50, Family ticket £5.95

Jesse Shirley built the mill at Etruria where materials could be easily transported to the nearby pottery factories. The Jesse Shirley and Sons company is still going and now has a modern mill at this site situated just behind the museum. Occasionally there is still a smell of ground bone in the air...

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;We were out exploring the beautiful Bishops Wood
and came across this area by chance. There are several statues of
farm animals here that look like they have been here for a while.
The statues are just off one of the main tracks in the woods, sat
amongst the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;All but one of them are recognisable as farm
animals, but what is the last one supposed to be? Maybe it was a
sculpture that was never finished? We'd love to know finder's
thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The cache is a regular sized lock-n-lock box,
hidden inside a camo bag. Please watch out for horse-riding muggles
while you are searching as they can appear at a moments notice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Although Wesport Lake is fine for people with pushchairs and permanent own wheelchair users, access to the nature walks at the side of the lake is inhibited due to bicycle barriers</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The main lake at Westport Lake is the largest body of water in the city of Stoke-on-Trent. The site also has a play area, smaller lake, grass and a woodland conservation area. Westport Lake is well known for its water birds and is popular with walkers and anglers. The site was designated as a Local Nature Reserve in July 2004.

Recently Westport Lake has seen major improvements with the installation of a play area, resurfacing of the car park and creation of pathways funded by the Greening for Growth programme.  Further improvements are taking shape on site with the building of a Visitor's Centre.

How to get to Westport Lake

Westport Lake lies off Brownhills Road in Longport.

Habitats and Wildlife

Westport Lake is an important overwintering site for many water birds and unusual birds often stop off at the lake during migration. The conservation area at the back of the site is home to many animals including shovellers, kingfishers and dragonflies. The conservation area is open to walkers but not anglers.

Walking at Westport Lake

The main lake is surrounded by a good, level footpath which is one mile long. A health walk through the conservation area was opened in March 2004. There is a variety of signed routes, which vary in length, and a good path surface.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The village church of St. Luke's Tittensor is located close to the busy A34 main road. Designed by Thomas Roberts, a local architect, it was built in 1880 of stone, brick and tiling with a timber framed top to the tower and a timber framed gable at the west end.

The northeast tower contains a clock and six bells, which have been rung by the Williamson family for more than 70 years.

Our attention was drawn to this church by John from The Bolas Heathens.

The cache is a nano so please take your own pen.

Parking can be found off Bracken Close, PLEASE USE THIS PARKING. 

The cache is close to the A34, approximately 3 metres off the edge of the road so please keep an eye on geokids. 

Happy Caching

"3" /&gt; We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank The Washers for conceiving the
idea, initiating the series and inviting other cachers to add to
it. Shropshire has its Church Gems, but so does Staffordshire and
hopefully can become just as popular. This is Staffordshires second
Church Gem.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">St John&amp;rsquo;s church was built over a relatively short period
from 1868 to 1870 with the consequence that there is a great
uniformity of style. The style is decorated Gothic, typical of the
14th century, executed with a dignified restraint which fully
justifies its Grade II* listing. The present church is believed to
have been preceded by one built by the Knights Templar in the 12th
century. Nothing of this church remains nor of the Georgian Church
which was the result of a rebuilding incorporating the medieval
tower completed in 1790.
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a short multi. The co-ordinates are for stage one,
a bench, all you need to do is count the number of letters in the
surname of the husband and wife who this bench is in memory of.
This = A The final cache can then be found at: 53°00 . (A+1)4 A
2°1(A+3) .4(A-1)5 Please be respectful of the surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking for stage one is best in the church car park just off
Church Fields 53° 00. 247 2° 17.133 Parking for stage two is best
at 53° 00. 584 2° 17.366 &lt;b&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES PARK ON THE

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Church, St Mary &amp; All Saints, is a small ancient edifice, with a half-timbered turret, and was a chapel of ease to Stoke-upon-Trent until 1807. The benefice is a rectory in the patronage of Captain Rowland Mainwaring, and the Rev CH Mainwaring, BA, is the incumbent.

Whitmore is a neat rural village, in a deep romantic valley, four and a half miles SW of Newcastle-under-Lyme, comprising within its parish 367 inhabitants, and about 3350 acres of land.

Thomas Twyford (1849-1921) is buried in this churchyard.
He invented the single piece, ceramic toilet. He also made infamous Thomas Crapper's toilet.

At the time of his death he was recognised as a leading pioneer in the application of principles of hygiene to sanitary appliances. Thomas lived in Whitmore Hall and therefore it seemed fitting he is buried at St Mary’s and All Saints Church.

The above co ordinates are for Twyfords grave site, to obtain the co ordinates of the cache, you need to count the number of ornate wooden posts which connect the fencing that surrounds the Twyford monuments. This = A.

The final cache can then be found at
52° 57.(977-A)
2° 17.(080-A)

The cache is a nano, please take your own pen and be respectful of the surroundings. 

A very short multi which should take about ten minutes.

There is no need to stray from the paths in the churchyard to find stage one. The final is just outside the church grounds.

Happy Caching
Mark &amp; Annie

Thanks to church wardens Mike &amp;amp; Cliff who were polite enough to
listen to me explain the joys of geocaching! They are happy for
this cache to stay but have asked me to stress to cachers that
THERE IS NO NEED WHATSOEVER FOR ANYONE TO GO INTO THE CHURCH
GROUNDS TO GET THIS CACHE. I've also changed the clue to make
finding this cache a smidge easier - but not too easy!&lt;br /&gt;

.&lt;br /&gt;
St Paul's Church was 100 years old in 2008. An Anglican church
which is situated to the East of Newcastle town centre. It is
renowned for having one of the best church organs in the area,
which Annie has been fortunate enough to play on a couple of
occasions. Fred, the resident organist is superb &amp;amp; his concerts
are well worth going to. Regular half hour lunchtime concerts take
place on the 2nd Tuesday of the month &amp;amp; there are regular
Wednesday evening organ concerts throughout Summer. Email us if you
want to know what concerts are planned and we'll find out for
you.&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks must go to Father Neil for allowing us to place this cache
originally. But sadly, Father Neil died suddenly in Dec 2008, so
the church wardens are now aware of this cache. The cache is a nano
so please take your own pen.&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
A nano, but not magnetic.&lt;br /&gt;
Happy Caching Mark &amp;amp; Annie&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Special thanks to Drs. I. Stimpson &amp;amp; P.
Knight of Keele University who inspired this cache during a field
trip organised in Oct 2007. Thanks also to Bob Fletcher, who’s
article
&lt;a href="http://www.esci.keele.ac.uk/nsgga/bulletin/bull084.html"
target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;“How Grey Was My Valley”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the 84th
edition of the NSGGA bulletin, filled the gaps in my own
knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SUGGESTED ROUTE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The suggested route for this cache is ca. 4
miles long following public footpaths &amp;amp; clearly marked pathways
previously used to support mining during the industrial revolution.
The route starts &amp;amp; finishes at the Apedale Heritage Centre,
where you will find parking &amp;amp; refreshments. It also takes you
on a journey through the geological heritage of the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;You can find instructions for the suggested
route with a downloadable memory map overlay file
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.suebrown.me.uk/geocaching/Apedale.htm"
target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; However, please bear in mind, the
tasks of the earthcache can be completed by taking a slightly
shorter direct route if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The co-ordinates above are for the car park.
There are very good footpaths all around the site. Please do not
veer from these footpaths. The fenced areas provide protection for
wildlife &amp;amp; hide a maze of mine shafts not marked on official OS
maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO LOG THE CACHE YOU MUST COMPLETE 6 TASKS
FROM AMONGST THE FOLLOWING STAGES &amp;amp; EMAIL THE ANSWERS TO THE
CACHE OWNER VIA GC.COM.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 1 – Apedale Heritage Centre –
N53°01.949' W002°15.958'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.apedale.co.uk/"
target="_blank"&gt;Apedale Heritage Centre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a museum to the
mining industry in North Staffordshire. It also presides over the
site which was once used to mine the Great Row to Bassey Mine
coals. If you wish to take a tour down the mine it takes ca. 1 hour
&amp;amp; costs £4 for adults &amp;amp; £2 for children &amp;amp; concessions.
From here you can see an excellent section through a coal seam with
the ironstone roof &amp;amp; soft clay underneath. The combination of
coal, ironstone &amp;amp; clay in such close proximity is typical of
the blackband ironstones found in North Staffordshire. The Great
Row coal was particularly advantageous to the potters since it
burnt with a long flame &amp;amp; distributed the termperature evenly
within the kiln. (The museum also holds information about the Roman
settlement at nearby Holditch dating back to the first
century).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TASK&lt;/b&gt; – Apedale Country Park has grown out
of old opencast land which was once heavily mined for coal. It was
not until the early 1990s that opencast workings in the valley
finally ceased. However, coal was not the only mineral that was
mined in Apedale. In the Heritage centre you will find information
about two other materials which were mined at Apedale. What were
they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 2 – Cannel Row Coal Seem - N53°01.995'
W002°15.985'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;When you come out of the heritage centre you
will see a small reserve to your right at the base of a small
cliff, showing the weathered exposure of a coal seam. If you look
to the top of the cliff you should be able to identify the black
layer of the Cannel Row Coal seam. This coal seam lies in the upper
coal measures lying closest to the surface of the ground. Its name
is derived from “Candle” meaning this coal has a very high hydrogen
content &amp;amp; burns very brightly. In times gone by candles were
carved from this coal because it burns so brightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 3 – The Giant Club-Moss - N53°02.009'
W002°15.984'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;A little further in to this mini reserve you
will see a topograph. Embedded in the walls of the topograph are
plaster casts of various fossils found during excavations at
Apedale. One of these casts is the fossil of what is known to be
the bark of a giant club-moss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="500" border="1" align="center" bordercolor="#CCCCCC"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/FPAS/bcs/bl14apl/Fossl.GIF"
width="117" height="204" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the Late Carboniferous Period (315-305 million years
ago) much of this area was covered by dense tropical swamp-forests
(known as Coal Forests). The dominant plants in these forests were
giant club-mosses. These tree-sized plants grew to heights of up to
40m in as little as 20 years. However, only when the plant became
mature did it produce a crown of branches, which bore the cones.
Having reproduced, the plant then died. As the trunk grew, pieces
of bark were shed &amp;amp; are regularly found fossilised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Website for Welsh Cultural
History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr align="center" valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TASK&lt;/b&gt; - Can you identify the latin name for the fossil of
this giant club-moss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/PageMill_Images/image212.gif"
     width="111" height="200" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 4 – Ironstone - N53°02.505'
W002°16.327'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;In addition to the coal measures the various
ironstones found at apedale proved to be of equal importance to the
industrial heritage &amp;amp; prosperity of the region. With the
building of the first blast furnace in 1785, the birth of pig iron
production began. By 1839, 600 workers were recorded to be working
on the site. This continued to increase as iron production was
supported through the building of coking ovens &amp;amp; eventually the
apedale canal. (Although the apedale canal no longer exists you can
still see the turning basin known as “gresley pool” at N53°02.563'
W002°16.289'.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;At &lt;b&gt;N53°02.209' W002°15.960'&lt;/b&gt; you will find
a piece of Ironstone typical of that mined in the last 2
centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TASK&lt;/b&gt; - At &lt;b&gt;N53°02.505' W002°16.327'&lt;/b&gt;
you will find a piece of rock containing Iron nodules which looks
like the picture below. The Ironstone nodules in this picture would
have been too insignificant to mine. Roughly how wide (in cm) is
the largest of these Ironstone nodules?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.suebrown.me.uk/geocaching/Apedale_files/07.jpg"
     width="640" height="480" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 5 – Rocky Outcrop - N53°02.599'
W002°16.766'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;As you continue along this path you will pass
the Apedale Road to Chesterton which passes through several clay
pits which have fed the brick factory at Holditch. The best current
example in the area of these Etruria Marls can be found at
N53°01.139' W002°15.659' (although this Marl Pit is not included on
this walk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Eventually, you will come to a rocky outcrop on
your left. This outcrop shows the boundary of the Banbury coal
seam. This sandstone is a mature sediment carried by river from
France resulting in very even grains in the stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 6 – The Apedale Volcano - N53°02.583'
W002°17.048'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;At the above co-ordinates you will find a style.
Do not cross the style, but do take a look at the view. You are now
stood in the mouth of the Apedale Volcano, which was live over 300
million years ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;In 1920/21 Sir John Cadman embarked on a
drilling programme seeking oil in North Staffordshire. An
exploratory borehole was sunk to 1294m near to Stage 8. No oil was
found but instead evidence of what we now know to be a Volcano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TASK&lt;/b&gt; - Much more recently (only 20000
years ago!) the current landscape was formed by the rolling
glaciers of the last ice age. Look out over the style &amp;amp; see if
you can imagine the ice cliff of a huge glacier to the West, behind
a pool of glacial meltwater. It might have looked something like
this! (There is no right or wrong answer for this task - just an
imagination required)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.suebrown.me.uk/geocaching/Apedale_files/10.jpg"
     width="640" height="480" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;You are also now stood on a central drainage
channel (watershed), which you will pick up again at Stage 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 7 – The Chimney - N53°02.181'
W002°16.482'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Robert Edensor Heathcote was the mine &amp;amp;
major landowner at Apedale. He was resident in Apedale Hall which
is now demolished. However, an unofficial monument to Robert
heatchote Esq. remains in the form of a chimney which can be found
in Watermills Woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The original height of the chimney was 186ft
&amp;amp; its purpose was to provide a ventilation shaft for the mine.
Only the decorated base remains which bears inscriptions on all
four sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TASK&lt;/b&gt; - What do the four inscriptions on
each side of the Chimney say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;At the time of writing the chimney was covered
in Scaffold. Let’s hope it’s being restored! Until the scaffold is
removed it may be necessary to do some internet research to answer
this question.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stage 8 – The Apedale Fault - N53°01.874'
W002°16.375'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Apedale Fault is a major fault running through
North Staffordshire, &amp;amp; possibly beyond. It runs the length of
the valley &amp;amp; here has a maximum displacement of around 600m.
The start of this walk follows the trail of the Apedale fault
through the Apedale valley. It can be seen clearly from this map.
Although, you also have a great view of the fault running through
the valley from this waypoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.stokecoll.ac.uk/nscfweb/Boardman/try1a.JPG"
width="640" height="480" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;From this viewpoint we again pick up the central
drainage channel (or watershed) first referred to at Stage 6.
Rainwater falling to the left of this ridge will drain across the
cheshire plains &amp;amp; out into the Irish Sea. Rainwater falling to
the right will drain into the river Trent &amp;amp; eventually out into
the North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;These channels have all been carved out by
meltwater from the glaciers which stretched across the West of
England from the Irish Sea ca. 20000 years ago. Silverdale, Apedale
&amp;amp; Lymedale amongst others were all carved by the meltwater that
ran off these glaciers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;b&gt;TASK&lt;/b&gt; - On top of the hill by the mining
memorial you will see a circle of railway sleepers each offering a
different viewpoint. Using the names on the railway sleeper markers
can you identify the names of the features which also lie on the
watershed just a few miles to the north &amp;amp; south of this
memorial?&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Penkhull has many public houses but The Greyhound is the one with the most history. 

The original building dates back to circa 1540, during the time of the Tudor Royals, when it was built as a "one large room" yeoman's house (a yeoman historically being a man holding a small landed estate).

From 1558 to 1829 it was used for the monthly Manorial court for the Mayor of Newcastle-under-Lyme, trying local residents on all manner of charges from stealing a loaf of bread to murder. With the lockup being underneath the courtrooms in the basement of the building

In 1662, it was known as Penkhull Hall, owned by one William Tyttensor. During this year, King Charles II travelled to Newcastle to ensure the family of Major Thomas Harrison, who had signed the death warrant for Charles I, was outlawed. He stayed overnight at Penkhull Hall, where, true to form, he indulged in a dalliance with the owner's daughter, Sarah Tyttensor. Upon discovering this, her father engaged the King in a sword fight, and, when the King momentarily lost his balance on the stairs, brought his sword down in a mighty thrust, missing the King by inches and embedding it into one of the stairs, the cut still visible today. The arrival of the 'King's Men' brought about Tyttensor's swift arrest for high treason and he was escorted to London where he was executed, his headless body being returned to Penkhull, where it was buried in Stoke Church yard.

In 1704 the building was enlarged to its present size, and between 1802 and 1828 was owned by another yeoman, John Townsend, who divided it into three dwellings. 
In 1829 one George Thomas Taylor bought the 1704 building and converted it into a Public and Victualling House, laying the foundations of the pub as we know it today. In 1936, Parkers Brewery of Burslem acquired the old c. 1540 hall and incorporated it into the Greyhound Inn that you see today. 

Please take your own pen and be as discrete as you can.

Happy caching

This cache is a multi, it shouldn’t take long, but to solve it you need to visit an important location to the pottery industry in Stoke on Trent. By completing Master Potter – Josiah Spode you will find (in the cache) a number which you will need to obtain the bonus cache, Master Potter – The Kiln.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There are four Master Potters you will need to obtain the co ordinates for the bonus cache.

Master Potter – Henry Doulton

Master Potter – Josiah Spode

Leading to Master Potter – The Kiln

Josiah Spode (23 March 1733 – 1797) was an English potter born in a village that is now part of Stoke-on-Trent. Spode was a pauper's son and also a pauper's orphan at the age of six. He earned renown in the pottery business by his only fortunate circumstance of being born in Staffordshire. It was here that he perfected the blue underglaze printing process in 1784 and developing the formula for fine bone china, also known as porcelain.
Spode was a former apprentice of potter Thomas Whieldon, but left when Whieldon took in Josiah Wedgwood as a business partner.

Spode opened a factory in Stoke-on-Trent in 1767. In 1776, he became owner of the current Spode factory, still in operation today. His business in creamware (a fine cream-coloured earthenware) and in pearlware (a fine white-glazed earthenware) was very successful.

Josiah Spode had a son, Josiah Spode II (b. 1755), who carried on the business. He was magnificently prepared for the role, an experienced salesman as well as a potter, having gained an invaluable knowledge of marketing in fashionable London.
The Spode factory remains in operation in Stoke-on-Trent

The co ordinates listed are for the Spode family grave 
The question you need to solve to find the cache is:

T = Josiah Spode was married to Ellen, but what year did she die? 18T2 

You will find the micro at:

Canister&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know about any other cachers but I get soooo bored going
up and down the motorway - and there is nothing worse than hearing
that there are QUEUES AHEAD! arrghh ... "stay on or get off .. stay
or getoff???" then you end up contemplating so much that you miss
the slip road and have to stay on, sometimes for hours!
*yaaawn*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now - with living in S-o-T i know how long and boring J15 - J16
is (and vice versa) and there can be so many traffic jams! might be
nothing but then you get the crane necks gawping at nothing and
slowing everybody down (we all do it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you fancy like slipping off at one of these junctions and
heading on down (or up) the A500, then you will be pleased to know
that I have put out a series of 10 caches along the A500 to keep
you amused while you sneak ahead of all the traffic on the motorway
and jump ahead a junction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caches numbered 1 - 8 are meant to be nice quick and easy cache
and dashes, a couple you barely even have to step a foot out of the
car! (thats if you park in the right place heehee) They are either
35mm Canisters or click and lock boxes for swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caches number 9 and 10 are the BONUS caches!! There is 1 placed
North and 1 placed South close to the Juntion slip road. To get the
actual co-ords for these you need to collect ALL of the other
caches numbered 1 - 8. Inside each one, written somewhere on the
log there is a letter and a number (eg A=9) collect all of these
and get the BONUS cache before you join the motorway again.
EASY!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOW - the fun part is ... instead of your boring old usual
geoswag in the bonus caches, I have placed a PRIZE for the FTF - a
cool prize and a booby prize heehee - in one there is a poor little
badge, in the other I have placed a memory stick that I have never
used patiently waiting inside its gift box for someone to collect
it --- BUT which bonus cache is it in? who knows!!! I made them
look the same, filled them up - then got Lindiloo to mingle them
round ... i have nooo idea :o)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO - what you waiting for? Take the next slip road and get
hunting! The caches will take you off the A500 briefly but all you
need to do then is get back on again - all the caches are close to
the A500 so you wont have to go far from it. For the little
geocachers in the car there might be some fun stuff to do on the
way if the grown ups will let you out of the car for a bit of a
break before joining the motorway again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches have been placed in good faith, please take care when
you park and put your safety first at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Junction 15 - 16: A500 Series&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;# 6 'Old Karate'&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know about any other cachers but I get soooo bored going
up and down the motorway - and there is nothing worse than hearing
that there are QUEUES AHEAD! arrghh ... "stay on or get off .. stay
on or getoff???" then you end up contemplating so much that you
miss the slip road and have to stay on, sometimes for hours!
*yaaawn*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now - with living in S-o-T i know how long and boring J15 - J16
is (and vice versa) and there can be so many traffic jams! might be
nothing but then you get the crane necks gawping at nothing and
slowing everybody down (we all do it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you fancy like slipping off at one of these junctions and
heading on down (or up) the A500, then you will be pleased to know
that I have put out a series of 10 caches along the A500 to keep
you amused while you sneak ahead of all the traffic on the motorway
and jump ahead a junction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caches numbered 1 - 8 are meant to be nice quick and easy cache
and dashes, a couple you barely even have to step a foot out of the
car! (thats if you park in the right place heehee) They are either
35mm Canisters or click and lock boxes for swaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caches number 9 and 10 are the BONUS caches!! There is 1 placed
North and 1 placed South close to the Juntion slip road. To get the
actual co-ords for these you need to collect ALL of the other
caches numbered 1 - 8. Inside each one, written somewhere on the
log there is a letter and a number (eg A=9) collect all of these
and get the BONUS cache before you join the motorway again.
EASY!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOW - the fun part is ... instead of your boring old usual
geoswag in the bonus caches, I have placed a PRIZE for the FTF - a
cool prize and a booby prize heehee - in one there is a poor little
badge, in the other I have placed a memory stick that I have never
used patiently waiting inside its gift box for someone to collect
it --- BUT which bonus cache is it in? who knows!!! I made them
look the same, filled them up - then got Lindiloo to mingle them
round ... i have nooo idea :o)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO - what you waiting for? Take the next slip road and get
hunting! The caches will take you off the A500 briefly but all you
need to do then is get back on again - all the caches are close to
the A500 so you wont have to go far from it. For the little
geocachers in the car there might be some fun stuff to do on the
way if the grown ups will let you out of the car for a bit of a
break before joining the motorway again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All caches have been placed in good faith, please take care when
you park and put your safety first at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

"3" /&gt; This is the 'site of a 12th century motte and bailey castle
which was surrounded by a moat produced by damming the River Lyme.
The truncated motte and some foundations from the gatehouse remain,
but the stone keep has vanished, and the bailey is now built over
with houses.' We've placed this cache to encourage geo-cachers to
visit what remains of the original 12th century castle that our
town is named after.&lt;br /&gt;
Mark never knew this was here, so Annie thought she would educate
him and introduce other cachers to the site in case it isn't
well-known.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy caching! Mark and Annie&lt;/p&gt;

the M6 which is only a stones throw away.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We used to spend ages playing in these woods as kids, with them
being a convenient footpath between two country lanes that we used
to cycle along. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache contains a small selection of goodies and a number of
travel bugs, including my very first to be launched on to the
world, GeoHikes – Right Foot Forward. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I recommend parking at Hanchurch Hills picnic area (N 52° 54.416 W
2° 14.431/OS SJ 839400) and completing
&lt;a href="http://www.geohikes.co.uk/index.php?option=content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=19&amp;amp;Itemid=29"
   target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;this GeoHike, Hanchurch Walk.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which
   visits two other caches,
   &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=654d4445-ec9b-4a9b-9340-12fbbaa70a41"
   target="_blank"&gt;GCJZD0 The Green Drive&lt;/a&gt; and

   target="_blank"&gt;GCH55B A Little Oak&lt;/a&gt;, with more to follow!
   &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you've already visited those caches or aren't up to the GeoHike,
parking is available at either end of the footpath. Either park
near the motorway bridge at N52° 56.467 W2° 12.961/OS SJ 856382 or
under the motorway at N52° 56.820 W2° 13.043/OS SJ 855389). If you
choose the later, please be careful walking through the working
sawmill that the public footpath passes through.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;General guidelines for the Alchemy
Quest... 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Inside each cache (except for Gold) are half the
co-ordinates to another one.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; They are printed on a laminated sheet of paper and written on
the front of the log book.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; DO NOT REMOVE THIS PIECE OF PAPER!&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Therefore copy on to paper, type into your GPS or take a
picture of these co-ordinates as you'll need them if you want to do
the whole quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; DO NOT over-cram the pots full of stuff! I have purposely
not put much in the caches to begin with as I'm running out of
goodies and people have been very generous with my other caches!
I'd rather you not leave anything than the cache leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Small travel bugs can be placed in the lesser caches and
larger ones in Gold (which is an ammo box).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; DO NOT give the co-ordinates you have found to other
cachers as it defeats the point of the quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It may be best to take your own pen or pencil to sign the
log book in case the one left freezes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Please don't put the pots on their sides or upside-down as
there is a higher chance of water getting in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;gt; As I've mentioned above, the location of
Iron looks aross Ironbridge Gorge. There are some nice snack and
ice cream shops across the bridge (as well as toilets) which you
may like to visit. 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; There are many places to park, some are closer than others
and some charge. It was 50p for two hours on the car park nearest
the access path though if you really wanted to you could park on
the road for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; You will be able to stick to the path through Benthall Edge
Wood for most of the way, apart from the last stretch which will be
straight uphill (making the terrain a 3.5*)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; From the Pay and Display car park, walk up the steep road
*WHICH BENDS ROUND TO THE LEFT*; don't (I repeat, don't) take the
very obvious looking path which has a big gate in front of it. To
get on the correct path, look for a well small 'V' shaped stile on
your right (this can be quite overgrown in summer). You are on the
correct path if you see the dragon/alligator carved in wood. The
cache is somewhere up the bank to your left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If you are unsure of which path to take, have a look at
this &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=367170&amp;amp;y=303135&amp;amp;z=3&amp;amp;sv=367500,303500&amp;amp;st=4&amp;amp;ar=Y&amp;amp;dn=786"&gt;

&lt;div align="left"&gt;Situated in Bishop's Wood not too far from some
medieval glassworks. 
&lt;p&gt;It was very eerie when we placed this cache on a grey day in
March. Recent logging has taken place in the area, opening the
valley up like a huge arena. A massive wooden throne had been built
at the top of a hill and there was an abandoned encampment
(complete with tubular bells?!) in the small copse of trees that
have not been cut down. All this combined with seeing no other
people at all and the absolute silence (no cars!) made this a very

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as any map will show you, there are many ways to
approach this cache; I'll leave that decision up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck and don't get lost in there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;div align="center"&gt;This is one of eight Base/Green level
     caches in the Quest&lt;br&gt;
This means that the above co-ordinates are correct and anyone can
do it! 
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, it contains the North co-ordinates to
   &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=113276"&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;General guidelines for the Alchemy
Quest... 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Inside each cache (except for Gold) are half the
co-ordinates to another one.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; They are printed on a laminated sheet of paper and written on
the front of the log book.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; DO NOT REMOVE THIS PIECE OF PAPER!&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Therefore copy on to paper, type into your GPS or take a
picture of these co-ordinates as you'll need them if you want to do
the whole quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; DO NOT over-cram the pots full of stuff! I have purposely
not put much in the caches to begin with as I'm running out of
goodies and people have been very generous with my other caches!
I'd rather you not leave anything than the cache leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Small travel bugs can be placed in the lesser caches and
larger ones in Gold (which is an ammo box).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; DO NOT give the co-ordinates you have found to other
cachers as it defeats the point of the quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; It may be best to take your own pen or pencil to sign the
log book in case the one left freezes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Please don't put the pots on their sides or upside-down as
there is a higher chance of water getting in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;***&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="left"&gt;&amp;gt; As said above, the cache is hidden very
close to the entrance of a cave (unaccessable) which I know nothing
about. 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; There are two ways of approaching the site. The way we went
had sheer drops so be very careful if you have children with
you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Although I don't think this in on the tourist trail, make
sure the cache is hidden well (and doesn't look out of
place).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The first Harecastle canal tunnel was completed in 1777 by James
Brindley, to relieve congestion a second parallel tunnel was added
by Thomas Telford in 1827. These tunnels were cut through 2,897
yards of Harecastle Hill and link Kidsgrove and Tunstall on the
Trent and Mersey canal. It is said that Brindley's tunnel is so
straight that if you stand at one end of it, you can clearly see
the light at the other end approximately 1.75 miles away.&lt;br /&gt;
Today, only the tunnel built by Telford is still in use. This is
due to the mining subsidence around the original tunnel forcing its
closure. The area is also known for its distinctive orange-tinted
water in the canal, which is caused by minerals rather than
pollution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is located somewhere between the North and South portals
of the tunnel.&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to visit both portals (in any order) and use
information from each to calculate the cache co-ordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The North portal is at: N53 05.077 W002 14.657&lt;br /&gt;
According to the fading sign, how many yards to the church?
NNN&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The South portal is located at N53 03.777 W002 13.596&lt;br /&gt;
In what year was the replacement milepost placed? SSSS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is now a small plastic container located at N53 04.(201 +
NNN) W002 14.(SSSS – 1659)</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The king refers to the tree known as the king of the forest, often thought of as the most English of trees. Through the centuries the oak has been revered by druids, and has sheltered kings, today its hard wood is often used for furniture, but in days gone by it was used in buildings, especially churches, and for ships. If you plant a sapling in your youth, you will be lucky if you see it produce its first fruit when you reach your three score years and ten.

The general cache location is on the edge of King's Wood which is predominently oak, giving way to pine as you head northwest.

The cache is hidden very close to a well-used path, so please be stealthy. GPS coverage isn't brilliant, hence the difficulty rating. You are looking for a small decon container, please don't over-fill it if there is a danger the lid won't go back on, and try to leave the container upright to stop the rain getting in. There is a small pin badge for the FTF.

If you go from this cache to Banana Tree (GCXG6D), look out for a huge oak tree at N52° 27.668 W002° 12.901. Did I say look out for it? You can't really miss it, as its just off the main path. As far as I know this is the largest oak in the wood. Perhaps someone who knows about trees can tell me its age?</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This part of North Staffordshire can claim to have had an influence on the course of WWII. The Ace is perhaps misleading, as here it relates not to the Ace pilots of the war, but rather the designer of probably the best known planes they flew.

Reginald J Mitchell was born in nearby Butt Lane, Newcastle in 1895. He was an apprentice at Kerr Stuart and Company; a locomotive engineering works in Stoke-on-Trent, and he studied at the Wedgwood Technical College. He went to work for Supermarine in Southampton, and so impressed his employers that after 2 years he was Chief Designer, developing light aircraft, fighters, flying boats and bombers. In 1928 Supermarine become part of Vickers Ltd, and as part of the change Mitchell was required to stay with the company for 5 years - they couldn't do without him!

The Spitfire prototype, known as K5054, was developed over a period of time, and first flew on 5th March 1936. The "Spit" underwent developments throughout the following years, and played a huge part in the Second World War, as we know from the many films made, but unfortunatley Mitchell died of cancer in 1937, aged 42, never seeing the part his original designs played in the outcome of the war.

The local school in Butt Lane is named in his honour as is the Mitchell Memorial Theatre in Hanley. There are a number of tributes to Mitchell within a quarter of a mile of the cache - huge stylised outlines of some of his designs set into the landscape. The tributes are best viewed from a distance, and the largest one can be seen (just!) from the A500 - as you travel north look to your right and over the tree tops, and you may spot it. The additional waypoints will take you to some of them. If you want to get a close up of those on Reginald Mitchell Way, the best place to park is on the Focus car park off Marlborough Way. Spot the aptly named roads as you go.

For more information about Reginald Mitchell, visit the Potteries Museum, in Hanley, where you can see a real Spitfire, housed inside the Museum, and an exhibition about its designer.

After two unsuccessful hiding places I have now been able to move the cache to somewhere much closer to the planes. Be on the watch for muggles as the footpath is well used by dog walkers and cyclists. Please rehide the cache as well as you can, using the natural vegetation.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Fifth Monarchy Man - Thomas Harrison 1606-1660&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you know about the Civil War? You have probably heard of
the battles of Marston Moor and Naseby, and possibly Newbury and
Worcester. But the son of a butcher from Newcastle-under-Lyme
fought at these battles amongst others, reaching the lofty heights
of Colonel and then Major-General in Oliver Cromwell’s army, in
effect Cromwell's second-in-command. He was one of the judges at
the trial of King Charles (the only one who attended each day of
the trial), and was one of the signatories on the king’s death
warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison was a supporter of the fanatical Fifth Monarchy Men,
and believed to have been one of the leaders, for more information
&lt;a href=
"http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/fifth-monarchy.htm"&gt;click
here.&lt;/a&gt; and he was one of the first of Cromwell's men to be
brought to trial when the monarchy was restored. He was tried in
October 1660 and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.
Harrison is commemorated by a plaque in the centre of Newcastle at
the site of the house where he was born. Many people pass the
plaque often and never notice it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the town centre buildings there is poor GPS coverage near
the plaque. The given location is in a more open area not far away
where you need to find some numbers. If you can't get a fix on this
location check the first hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current cross was erected in 18A0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medieval cross was restored in 157B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deputy mayor commemorated the most recent restoration on CD
June 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now walk on a bearing of roughly 240 degrees to the plaque.
(Stand on the steps and you should be able to see it above
shoppers' heads.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore the top row of smaller letters, and look at the five
lines which refer to Thomas Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No of letters in the first line = EF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No of letters in the last line = GH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a short walk away at N53 00.BA(H-D) W0002
13.(F-C)(HxG)(B-E)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE&lt;/b&gt; I have shown this as not 24 hours.
Technically it is, however you will need to use a subway to reach
the final location, so I wouldn't recommend looking for this at
night unless you are in a group. I don't like subways in the
dark!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, no spoilers in your log or photos, or your log will be
removed. One last thing - you will need to bring your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;One of a series of caches in and around the Potteries. The
series is based around people, places, historic events, and
geographical or botanical features, but all with a link to a
playing card.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;The Queens Gardens in Newcastle-under-Lyme is a popular place to
sit and relax, especially during the summer months. In pride of
place is a stautue of Queen Victoria. However it hasn't always been
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/ff335972-128c-47db-951d-129f3a4874ea.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was given to the borough by the mayor and unveiled in 1903,
near where the big roundabout now is. However when the small road
was widened and the first roundabout built in the 1960s, the statue
had to go. It was relocated on Station Walks, the site of the
railway station on the old branch line from Stoke. Then almost
exactly 100 years after Victoria's death, the statue was moved back
to the gardens, and re-erected in its current position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is a simple enough multi, with a hunt for information
to keep the geokids busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache you will need to go first to the Queens
Gardens at the given coordinates. There is free parking in nearby
streets - though it can be tricky on Saturdays. Please don't try to
park in the pedestrianised zone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statue was unveiled by H.I.H. the Grand Duke ? The number of
letters in his name = A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statue was resited in 2001. How many letters in the month?
Answer = B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the sculptor's name on the statue, how many letters in his
surname? Answer = C&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a memorial placed by a nearby school remembering a local
hero. How many times was he decorated for bravery? (Don't rely on
counting the badges!) Answer = D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now walk to the subway and look at the murals. In the coloured
mural, what hour is on the Guildhall clock? Answer = E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other mural, count the bus windows. Answer = F&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have all the information you need to find the cache. You
should be able to spot Victoria's temporary location nearby from
the hollow in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N53° 00.(A+1)EB W002° 13.(C-2)DF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep a sharp lookout as the location is overlooked, and a
favourite with dog-walkers. Please bring your own pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hall of Fame&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is the first in a series of caches we are hoping to put out that are dedicated to the people who lost their lives in the coal mines of North Staffordshire.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is located close to a pit head wheel that has been put in place to commemorate the 78 men and boys that lost their lives on January 18th 1895in the Diglake mining disaster. It is located as you enter the villages of Audley and Bignall End.
It seems most likely that the shot fired on the morning of January 14th by William Sproston, fireman, brought down the barrier between the old pit and the new workings, allowing thousands of gallons of water to rush into Diglake Pit. However, since it was never possible to enter the flooded areas of the pit to confirm the point at which the water broke through, this is pure speculation. 
Two bodies were recovered at the time of the flood - Henry Holland and Henry Rhodes. In the 1930s, miners working in a newer colliery close to Diglake broke through into the old pit. They recovered three bodies, none of which were identified at the time. They were buried under the memorial at Bignall End. The remaining 72 bodies still lie where they fell in the abandoned pit, beneath the streets of Ravens Lane and Bignall End.

The cache is an official Geocache micro that was taken from The Cache Dispenser that was set up by the Bolas Heathens, thanks to them for providing the cache. Please note that you need to bring your own pen or pencil.

Congratulations to Tizzie on the FTF. As the cache has now been found we are openining it up to all cachers.</groundspeak:long_description>

All this area was once the site of Shelton Bar steel works that like most industry in the area has now gone. The area over the canal by the ski centre was the site of the garden festival that was used to regenerate the site after the first phase on the steel works shut. This is now a retail park and offices. The other side of the cut is also now being regenerated to supply industrial units and offices. Parking can be found at Water World or you may be able to park in the Doulton outlet centre near to the path down to the towpath.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">At the top of Apedale country park is an elevated pit wheel that was put in place to commemorate those of all ages who dedicated their lives to coal mining in Staffordshire. The wheel is 750 feet above sea level and can be can from a good distance away. The wheel, which is 19 feet in diameter was transported by the Territorial Army from Annesley Colliery in Nottinghamshire, The wheel - bought for just £100 - has now been placed on a specially-constructed stand above the Apedale Heritage Centre, which portrays miners' lives above and below ground. 

There were a large number of mines and footrails in the area and a number of deaths occurred at Burley pit that was close by. 
The park was created after the area was open cast mined and is now maturing rather well. The cache is a small container situated a short distance from the wheel. Parking is available off Black Bank Road, please check the time the gates are locked. If time is short you should be able to park next to the entrance.
Below the wheel in the valley is Apedale Heritage centre that offers underground visits, has a cafe and a mining museum, http://www.apedale.heritage.cwc.net/</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is a loc n loc box with an official and is just a few meters off well maintained paths. The area is well used by walkers so some stealth may be needed, it is also nettle and bluebell free.
Parking can be found after going onto a good track at the end of Apedale road. Only one stile needs to be crossed no matter which path you take.
Watermills Colliery Chimney, within the Apedale Community Country Park, dates from 1840 and is a Grade II listed building. It is the last surviving structure of the Watermills Colliery and has four weathered inscribed panels which read: “Regard the End”, “Live and Let Live”, “Be Just and Fear Not”, and ”REH 1840”. The last inscription is a reference to the Heathcote family, the mine owners, and stands for Richard Edward Heathcote. The Heathcote family were going through hard times at the time the chimney was built; it was the chimney to the steam engine and this was made into a monument by Heathcote when the pit closed. As Wedgewood had built one on the top of Talke which was in sight of Apedale Hall, so this was Heathcotes contribution. The chimney was originally 186 feet high.</groundspeak:long_description>

The highest cache in Stoke-On-Trent?? Wonderful views across the
city from Central Forest Park.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The city now named Stoke-on-Trent was officially born on the 31st
March 1910, with the Federation of the Six Towns. This brought
together the boroughs of Hanley, Burslem, Longton and Stoke,
together with the districts of Tunstall and Fenton. Stoke was
chosen as the seat of power, despite the fact that Hanley, and
indeed Burslem, had been far better established since Edwardian
times. The legacy of this union lives on undiminished, as locals
will refer to 'the Potteries', meaning the various towns, rather
than the official title of 'Stoke-on-Trent'.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hanley Forest Park is an great example of environmental restoration
(it used to be a colliery site). To find the cache and trig point
you will climb to the top of what we think used be to be a slag
heap (is that the official term?!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is one good path leading to the trig point. All other paths
are steep and slippery and should be attempted at your own
risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keep an eye on kids, there are some steep slopes around the cache
area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This site is very popular with muggles, so keep an eye out when
near the cache site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't forget to bring your kids / grandkids / nieces or nephews.
There's a fantastic play area for the little ones, and for
teenagers there's the UK's largest urban skate park.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Freya's favourite day out is at the excellent
Blists Hill Victorian Town and she has often commented that it
would be nice to set a cache nearby, so here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The OS Map shows the area as open but in fact
it's actually new(ish) woodland that is maturing very nicely. It's
a lovely place for a walk and somewhere we have been meaning to set
a cache at for some time. Further on down the path is a nice gorge
with stream along the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Parking is just down the hill from the entrance
to Blists Hill Victorian Town at N52 37.761 W2 27.231. Follow the
Public Footpath from the corner of the car park, onwards to the
cache. There are some quite steep steps to start off with but the
path levels out somewhat after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;You are looking for a camo'd regular size
tupperware container (no camo bag this time!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;In true Bolas Heathens spirit, bonus points are
awarded to those who post a 'Self portrait with the cache' along
with their log!&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is located in Hem Heath &amp;amp; Newstead Woods.&lt;br /&gt;
In the woods there is an extensive system of paths including an
all-ability circular path. &lt;br /&gt;
It is the largest area of woodland in Stoke on Trent.&lt;br /&gt;

The original cache container came from The Bolas Heathens Cache
Dispenser. Thanks to John and Issac. &lt;br /&gt;
The box contains a FTF pin and some small swops.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to take the details of the inside cover of the log
book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The paths get a little muddy after rain but you should be able to
get a push chair around the paths. There is a pond near by so
please look after the children. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Many thanks to the Staffordshire Wildlife team for permission to
place the cache. Please if you see any litter pick it up. There are
bins in the carpark.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is placed on the bridge above the A500 "D Road". It is known locally as the D road as when you look at a map the road along with the M6 form a large D. I also believe that at the planning stage is was refered to as the D road as D is the roman numeral for 500. Please do not attempt to get at the cache from the D road but use the road the bridge is on.
Thanks must go to The Bolas Heathens as this cache was kindly donated by them from their Refurbished Cache Dispenser, Thanks to John, Isaac and the rest of the heathens.</groundspeak:long_description>

 About Alsager. Alsager Railway Station serves the town of Alsager
in Cheshire. It was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway
company on October 9th, 1848. It is situated next to a level
crossing approximately 600 yards from the town centre. The station
is 6½ miles east of Crewe on the Crewe to Derby Line. The line
through Alsager was electrified in 2003 so that it could be used as
a diversionary route between Kidsgrove and Crewe during the West
Coast Main Line improvement work</groundspeak:long_description>

 The very fine Victorian station buildings were opened October 9,
1848. The other buildings located in Winton Square, including the
North Stafford hotel, were opened in June 1849. All these buildings
were to the design of H.A. Hunt of London, done in an architectural
style referred to as ‘robust Jacobean manor-house’ [1]. The station
was built by the North Staffordshire Railway Company and, until the
amalgamation of 1923, housed the Company's Boardroom and its
principal offices. Stoke-on-Trent has always been and still is the
hub of North Staffordshire's passenger train service Stoke-on-Trent
station is managed by Virgin Trains. It has three passenger
platforms, and one central through line without a platform. The
entrance to the station is from Winton Square, opposite the North
Stafford Hotel, into a large modern booking hall with an enquiry
office, quick ticket machines, an HSBC cashpoint and level access
to platform 1 from which all southbound and eastbound trains
normally depart. On this platform are the main buildings,
refreshment room and bar, a magazine and book stall, free
CCTV-covered cycle-locking racks, free toilets for both ladies and
gentlemen, a first class lounge, a post box, and offices for the
British Transport Police. There is both a tiled passenger subway
and a passenger operated lift connecting platform 1 with platforms
2 and 3. Northbound trains usually depart from platform 2, which
has a ladies' waiting room with toilets, and gentlemen's toilets.
Platform 3 is a short bay platform used by some regional trains to
Manchester Piccadilly. The station building retains much of its
mid-Victorian character, including a classic glazed roof that spans
the platforms, and is now a Grade II* listed building. A war
memorial, with brass nameplates naming local men who fell during
the wars, discreetly flanks the entrance to platform 1.</groundspeak:long_description>

 The History of Kidsgrove Station From the eighteenth century, it
grew around coal mining, although the mines have now closed. Clough
Hall Mansion is in the town, now demolished, was a local theme
park. Modern Kidsgrove is very much a commuter town and many people
now work in the larger cities such as Manchester and Birmingham –
only an hour’s drive away. Thomas Telford designed the Harecastle
Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal near the town. Kidsgrove also
marks the southern extremity of the Macclesfield Canal. There is an
urban legend regarding a headless ghost that is said to haunt the
Harecastle tunnel. The ghost is said to be that of a young woman
who was once murdered by a canal worker and is referred to as the
Kidsgrove Boggart. Kidsgrove is served by Kidsgrove railway station
which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on October 9th,
1848 as “Harecastle”. This station is still open as a junction.
However there were two other stations on the closed “loop” line
namely “Kidsgrove”, opened November 15, 1875 and “Kidsgrove Market
Street Halt” opened 1905</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Tree Stories is a quick cache to find before (or during, or after)
a shopping trip or meeting in Hanley, or a cache n' dash.The
co-ordinates will bring you to the tree after which this cache has
been named.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find the cache, you'll need to visit one of the below web-pages
to read about this 'interesting' tree.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Essential reading:-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/29/nstoke129.xml"&gt;
&lt;font size="5"&gt;Click Here - The Telegraph&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
or here...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6924490.stm"&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;
Click Here - BBC News&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the above web-pages, you'll need to find two items of
information:-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1 - How tall is the tree (in feet)?&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is &lt;b&gt;AAA&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
(if a website shows the height to decimal places - round
DOWN)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2 - How many thousands of pounds has this park-entrance development
cost?&lt;br /&gt;
The answer is &lt;b&gt;BBB&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
(e.g - £795,000.00 would mean BBB is 795).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache location is here:-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;N53°01.(866-AAA)
W002°10.(889-BBB)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you forget to look on the website before coming out, you could
probably ask a knowledgeable-looking passing muggle for the
answers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feel free to add your comments about this development to your log
on this cache page.&lt;br /&gt;

It's a really easy cache so you might need to check around before you retrieve it, as there may be lots of people around.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache was placed in celebration of Common Ground, a group art exhibition that took place in Hanley Park over the weekend of 26th and 27th June 2010.

20 new artworks were created and exhibited across the park. One still exists as a permanent installation. There were also events such as a brass band playing on the bandstand, children's mask making workshops and artist performances.

Most of the artists who took part donated a small piece for the cache.

Feedback from local residents suggested that the pavilion that sits in the centre of the park should be refurbished and put back into use and more events like this should be taking part in the park.

We hope you enjoy your visit.</groundspeak:long_description>

Placed in Parkhall country park, in an area close to Bolton Gate Stables where Leah enjoys riding horses out in the park.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Access to the cache can be found from a recognised track which is waypointed. From here access to the cache is on the other side of a hedgerow.

Parking is close by at Bolton Gate (height restriction)
N52.59.879 W002.05.797,  Easy access on foot, the access route from Bolton Gate is firm and accessible with a buggy but may be a little bumpy. Please note the final 25m to the cache position is not buggy friendly. Approx 30min there and back.

Additional Suggested Parking is at the Visitors Centre,
N53.00.018 W002.06.343. From this point you will have a good walk through the park. Approx 1hr 30min there and back.

We are hoping to get a few new caches out around campus for the
event. As this is Keele, we recommend you bring waterproofs just in
case &lt;img src=
'http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif'
border="0" align="middle" /&gt;, possibly a torch and some sturdy
shoes. Parking is available on any of the car parks on campus as it
is free at weekends! YAY!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This will be a great opportunity to meet some of the newer cachers
in the area as well as a general catch up for those of us who have
met before. &lt;img src=

&lt;br /&gt;
We may if you are lucky, take a leaf out of Mark &amp;amp; Annie's
(cannonedwards) book and organise a quiz!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="4" color="red"&gt;Look forward to seeing you all

This area has now become a little boggy and has some rubbish around, plus some overgrown brambles and such. This is an area that I hold close to my heart as I've got a lot of great memories here, from campfires in the past to coming back here to find the cache.

I'm currently attempting to get in contact with the groundstaff there to arrange a cleanup afternoon for the area and wondered if a few of the attending cachers wouldn't mind sparing half and hour or so before the event starts to lend a hand for a little bit!

If you're interested in helping out, pop me an email to scott@dor.ky so I can get a rough idea of how many would be interested in helping :)</groundspeak:text>

&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;um&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Blackbeard was the most notorious pirate in the history of
seafaring. With a beard that almost covered his face, he would
strike terror into the hearts of his victims, according to one
early account, by sticking cannon fuses under his hat, and lighting
them during battle. Reportedly a tall man, he added to his menacing
appearance by wearing a crimson coat, two swords at his waist, and
bandoleers stuffed with numerous pistols and knives across his
chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sight of Blackbeard was enough to make most of his victims
surrender without a fight. If they gave up peacefully, he would
usually take their valuables, navigational instruments, weapons,
and rum before allowing them to sail away. If they resisted, he
would often maroon the crews and burn their ship. Blackbeard worked
hard at establishing his devilish image, but there is no archival
evidence to indicate that he ever killed anyone who was not trying
to kill him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blackbeard's lawless career lasted only a few years, but his
fearsome reputation has long outlived him. Thought to have been a
native of England, he was using the name Edward Thatch when he
began his pirating sometime after 1713.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometime during the summerof 1717, Blackbeard encountered another
vessel flying the black flag. She was the ten-gun pirate sloop
Revenge from Barbados, commanded by Stede Bonnet, "The Gentleman
Pirate." Bonnet had been an educated and wealthy landowner before
turning to piracy. After inviting the Revenge to sail along with
him, Blackbeard soon realized that Bonnet was a poor leader and an
incompetent sailor. He appointed another pirate to command Revenge,
and forced Bonnet to become a "guest" aboard his ship, where he
remained a virtual prisoner, until the pirate company was split up
some months later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In November 1717, in the eastern Caribbean, Thatch took a 14-gun,
richly laden French slaveship called Concorde Thatch decided to
make Concorde his flagship, increased her armament to 40 guns, and
renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge (or QAR).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the winter of 1717-1718, QAR and Revenge cruised the
Caribbean, taking prizes. Along the way, Blackbeard decided to keep
two more smaller captured vessels. When he sailed northward up the
American coast in the spring of 1718, he was in command of four
vessels and over 300 pirates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blackbeard's reign of terror climaxed in a week-long blockade of
the port of Charleston, S.C. in May 1718. One week later, tQAR was
lost at Beaufort Inlet. One of the smaller vessels in Blackbeard's
flotilla, the ten-gun sloop Adventure, was lost the same day while
purportedly trying to assist the stranded flagship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before leaving Beaufort Inlet, Blackbeard marooned disgruntled
pirates on a deserted sandbar, stripped Bonnet's sloop Revenge of
her provisions, and absconded with much of the accumulated plunder
aboard another smaller vessel. Bonnet rescued the marooned men and,
with them, resumed his lawless ways aboard the Revenge, which he
re-named the Royal James.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In October 1718, Bonnet and his crew were captured near present-day
Wilmington, North Carolina, and taken to Charleston, where they
were tried for piracy. All except four were found guilty. All of
the rest except Bonnet were hanged that November 8th. (The record
of that trial, published in London in 1719, provided researchers
with important clues to the location of the QAR site.) Bonnet
escaped briefly, but was recaptured and then hanged on December 10,
1718.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, Blackbeard and his confidants had sailed to Bath Town,
then the capital of North Carolina, where they received pardons
from Governor Charles Eden. In November 1718, Governor Alexander
Spotswood of Virginia, knowing that Blackbeard and his men had
continued taking ships long after the period of amnesty had
expired, sent a Royal Navy contingent to North Carolina, where
Blackbeard was killed in a bloody battle at Ocracoke Inlet on
November 22, 1718. During the action, Blackbeard received a
reported five musketball wounds and more than 20 sword lacerations
before dying. Blackbeard had captured over 50 ships during his
piratical career, and his death virtually represented the end of an
era in the history of piracy in the New World.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;um&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Bartholomew Roberts (17 May 1682 &amp;ndash; 10 February 1722), born
John Roberts, was a Welsh pirate who raided shipping off the
Americas and West Africa between 1719 and 1722. He was the most
successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy, capturing far more
ships than some of the best-known pirates of this era such as
Blackbeard or Captain Kidd. He is estimated to have captured over
470 vessels. He is also known as Black Bart (Welsh: Barti Ddu), but
this name was never used in his lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was the pirate best known for inventing The Pirate's Code:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I. Every man has a vote in affairs of moment; has equal title to
the fresh provisions, or strong liquors, at any time seized, and
may use them at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing
among them) makes it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a
retrenchment.&lt;br /&gt;
II. Every man to be called fairly in turn, by list, on board of
prizes because, (over and above their proper share) they were on
these occasions allowed a shift of clothes: but if they defrauded
the company to the value of a dollar in plate, jewels, or money,
marooning was their punishment. If the robbery was only betwixt one
another, they contented themselves with slitting the ears and nose
of him that was guilty, and set him on shore, not in an uninhabited
place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter
hardships.&lt;br /&gt;
III. No person to game at cards or dice for money.&lt;br /&gt;
IV. The lights and candles to be put out at eight o'clock at night:
if any of the crew, after that hour still remained inclined for
drinking, they were to do it on the open deck.&lt;br /&gt;
V. To keep their piece, pistols, and cutlass clean and fit for
service.&lt;br /&gt;
VI. No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man were to
be found seducing any of the latter sex, and carried her to sea,
disguised, he was to suffer death.&lt;br /&gt;
VII. To desert the ship or their quarters in battle, was punished
with death or marooning.&lt;br /&gt;
VIII. No striking one another on board, but every man's quarrels to
be ended on shore, at sword and pistol. (The quarter-master of the
ship, when the parties will not come to any reconciliation,
accompanies them on shore with what assistance he thinks proper,
and turns the disputant back to back, at so many paces distance; at
the word of command, they turn and fire immediately, (or else the
piece is knocked out of their hands). If both miss, they come to
their cutlasses, and then he is declared the victor who draws the
first blood.)&lt;br /&gt;
IX. No man to talk of breaking up their way of living, till each
had shared one thousand pounds. If in order to this, any man should
lose a limb, or become a cripple in their service, he was to have
eight hundred dollars, out of the public stock, and for lesser
hurts, proportionately.&lt;br /&gt;
X. The captain and quartermaster to receive two shares of a prize:
the master, boatswain, and gunner, one share and a half, and other
officers one and quarter.&lt;br /&gt;
XI. The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath Day, but the other
six days and nights, none without special favour.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;um&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">William "Captain" Kidd (c. 1645 &amp;ndash; May 23, 1701)[1] was a
Scottish sailor remembered for his trial and execution for piracy
after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean. Some modern
historians deem his piratical reputation unjust, as there is
evidence that Kidd acted only as a privateer. Kidd's fame springs
largely from the sensational circumstances of his questioning
before the English Parliament and the ensuing trial. His actual
depredations on the high seas, whether piratical or not, were both
less destructive and less lucrative than those of many other
contemporary pirates and privateers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In September 1696, Kidd weighed anchor and set course for the Cape
of Good Hope. A third of his crew soon perished on the Comoros due
to an outbreak of cholera, the brand-new ship developed many leaks,
and he failed to find the pirates he expected to encounter off
Madagascar. Kidd then sailed to the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb at the
southern entrance of the Red Sea, one of the most popular haunts of
rovers on the Pirate Round. Here he again failed to find any
pirates. According to Edward Barlow, a captain employed by the
British East India Company, Kidd attacked a Mughal convoy here
under escort by Barlow's East Indiaman, and was beaten off. If the
report is true, this marked Kidd's first foray into piracy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As it became obvious his ambitious enterprise was failing, he
became understandably desperate to cover its costs. But, once
again, Kidd failed to attack several ships when given a chance,
including a Dutchman and New York privateer. Some of the crew
deserted Kidd the next time the Adventure Galley anchored offshore,
and those who decided to stay behind made constant open-threats of
mutiny.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;um&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">In the early 13th century, the most feared man to sail the waters
of the English channel was a former monk named Eustace - a talented
and storied adventurer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eustace's fleet performed many duties during this war, pillaging
and plundering French coastal towns and destroying French ships.
King John felt he needed Eustace's ships enough that when the
pirate&amp;rsquo;s ships began to raid English towns as well, King John
went so far as to issue him a full pardon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, like any good pirate, Eustace the Monk's relationship with
England didn't last long. In 1212, after the British began to seize
several of the island assets he had claimed in the English Channel,
Eustace decided to side with the French instead. In 1215, a Civil
War broke out in England, which France took as their opportunity to
invade, with Eustace the Monk's help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And this is how Eustace the Monk made enemies of both England and
France and became the most feared and despised of men.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Cornelius Essex (died 1680) was an English buccaneer who took part
in Captain Bartholomew Sharp's privateering expedition, the
"Pacific Adventure", during the late 1670s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although much of his early life is unknown, he is first recorded
being brought with his ship, the Great Dolphin, to Port Royal by
HMS Hunter in November 1679 and tried with twenty of his crew for
"riotously comporting themselves" as well as charges of looting the
plantation of a Major Samuel Jenck's of St. James' parish for which
two men were sentenced to death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Essex, as did the other Captains, held a commission by the Jamaican
government that granted them permission to cut logwood in Honduras
and left Port Morant in December 1679 with Captain John Coxon,
Robert Allison, Thomas Mackett, Jean Rose and a Captain Bournano
and rendezvoused at the Isles of Pines near eastern Panama shortly
after.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following the election of Coxon as head of the party, the
privateers traced the old route Sir Henry Morgan had taken in his
raid on Portobello in 1668. After anchoring at a deserted cay, he
was one of the privateers that participated in the overland assault
on the Spanish stronghold and was among thirty others killed in a
surprise attack against the garrison.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;um&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As pirates go, Red Legs Greaves was not only a successful one but
also a lucky one. He managed to survive his life as a pirate and
live to ripe old age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What makes this even the more remarkable was how his life began.
Greaves was born in Barbados, the son of Scottish slaves. Anyone
familiar with the movie "Captain Blood" recalls the scene at the
beginning of the movie where several men are tried for treason and
eventually sold into slavery. This was a common practice in England
and was the case of the parents of Greaves. Apparently Greaves'
father was the on the wrong side of the Civil war when Cromwell
came to power, as were many people in Scotland and Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A short time after the elder Greaves arrived in Barbaboes as a
slave, young Greaves was born and while the new son had nothing to
do with the Civil War in England, he paid for the sins of his
father and was a slave from the moment of birth. At first, life as
a slave was at least tolerable becuase Greaves had a kind master.
But his life took a turn for the worse after his parents as well as
his master died and the orphaned boy was sold to another master who
delighted in beating the young man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While still in his teens, Greaves decided his only hope for
survival was to run away and one night he swam across Carlisle Bay
in attempt to find his freedom. After making his escape, Greaves
stowed away aboard a ship hoping to sail off to a safe harbor.
Unfortunately the ship belonged to a notorious pirate known as
Captain Hawkins. Hawkins was known throughout the Caribbean as an
unusually cruel captain, who found joy in torturing his captives
and mistreating women. He rarely offered quarter to ships he
attacked and was feared by even his own crew. The only reason his
crew remained loyal to him was because he had a knack for finding
rish prizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once Hawkins found Greaves stowed away on his ship he gave him the
option of signing the ship's Articles, no doubt offering the
articles on a platter along with a pistol. It is uncertan if
Greaves would have signed the Articles without threat but once
driven to the calling of piracy, Greaves became very efficient, and
quickly rose to eminence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Despite his success, Greaves' childhood as a slave led him to hate
Captain Hawkins. Greaves refused to kill for no reason and would
not partake in torturing prisoners. It didn't take long for the two
men with distinctly different moral codes to come to blows. While
it is said that the two men had a duel over the issue, it is more
likely Hawkins attacked Greaves for not following his orders and
bloody fight ensued. In the end, Greaves managed to kill Hawkins
and the crew which had lived in fear of the cruel Hawkins
immediately elected Young Greaves the new Captain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Greaves in turn drew up a new set of Ship's Articles which were
more to his liking, which gave stiff penalties for maltreatment of
prisoners and women and a willigness to offer quarter. Much to the
delight of Greaves and his crew, what followed was a period of the
highest piratical success. As his reputation spread thoughout the
Caribbean "Red Leg" Greaves became known for his humanity and
morality. He never tortured his prisoners, nor ever robbed the
poor, nor maltreated women.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His greatest success of all was his capture of the Island of
Margarita, off the coast of Venezuela. On this occasion, after
capturing the Spanish Fleet, he turned the guns of their warships
against the forts, which he then stormed, and was rewarded by a
huge booty of pearls and gold. And as was true to his form, he
didn't sack the town, or rape and torture the Sapniards, he just
took the money and ran.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having made off with enough money to last a life time, Greaves
retired to the respectable life of a planter in the Island of
Nevis. The story would end at this point but unfortunately for
Greaves, one of his former victims happened to cross his path and
turned him in for the bounty on his head.As was typical of the time
he was quickly tried and found guilty and sentenced to be hanged in
chains. (Moral or not, he was a pirate!) He was cast into a dungeon
to await execution, when the great earthquake came which destroyed
and submerged the town in 1680, and one of the few survivors was
Greaves. Greaves was rescued by a whaling ship and in turn he
joined the crew and served remarkably well. Later he would turn
pirate hunter and received a pardon for his earlier crimes after
assisting in the capturing a gang of pirates that habe been
ravaging the whaling fleets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After Greaves became a legally free and pardoned man he once again
retired to a plantation becoming well known for being a charitable
and kindly man who gave generously to many public institutions.
Greaves died of old age, universally respected and missed by all in
his community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Greaves got his nickname "Red Legs" from his heritage. The kilt
wearing Scots were known for going bare legged in any weather and
this lifestyle led to "red legs" in the Caribbean sun. Red Legs was
a common nickname for the Scots and the Irish.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache may be obvious, or it may take you a while to find it. The container used to house my "Dark Angels" but it's been quite heavily modified ;-)

Please, please replace it as you found it to ensure it doesn't get muggled. It is in virtually the same area as our previous cache *Cache of the Beast* but we felt a more covert cache was needed after it was muggled. Put your stealth hats on!

You can get to this Cache by using the disused railway line and using the break in the wall to enter the field. You can access the footpath from Orford Road, but please use the shop/chemist for parking, down Station Road. You can visit our other caches in the area, *The Big Tease* and *Two Board to Notice*

GPS isn't spot on. It always bounces here for me, but take a step back and have a ponder :-)

The path isn't suitable for small children (except ones in slings) or buggies as it can get quite overgrown at some points in the year.

The field where the cache is located contains cows/sheep. They mostly keep themselves to themselves (actually they're quite nice for the most part!) and most of the field is now fenced off depending on your direction of travel.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Park Hall Country Park opened in 1981 after 6 years of
reclamation work in the former Hulme Quarry. It has a visitor
centre (open from Thursday to Sunday), toilets, car parks and a
number of easy to challenging walks (that take you to other near-by
caches).&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/76375312-f579-4ac6-afbd-2bf0a71b2ace.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Country Park lies on a sandstone ridge comprising red
sandstone and conglomerate pebble beds laid down in the Lower
Triassic period (some 215 to 250 million years ago) when Britain
lay just north of the equator. The environment at the time was that
of a hot arid desert and the sandstone and pebble beds were
deposited on the ancient landscape by flash floods and intermittent
rivers. It is possible that each bed of pebbles was laid down in
one event over a short period of days or weeks rather than
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pebbles seen here are quartzite (a hardish reddish/grey
rock), quartz (a hard grey/white mineral) as well as granite (with
interlocking crystals of feldspar, quartz and mica), and porphyry
(a pinkish rock with scattered crystals of feldspar and quartz).
All the pebbles are well rounded showing they have been transported
long distances by water; and the granite and porphyry pebbles
originated in what is now the South West of England and North West
of France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the flash floods subsided, very thick layers of sands and
gravels were deposited as horizontal bars on the beds of wide river
channels, with finer materials settling out in quieter waters.
Evidence of these beds can be seen in the quarry faces. At the edge
of sand or gravel bars the moving sediments avalanche down the
slopes and can now be seen as diagonal lines in the rock termed
cross-bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/28edd834-2537-4687-be67-f8fe4e4dc383.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over millions of years of later earth movements, the rocks have
been uplifted, tilted, faulted and eroded, long before quarrying
began here less than 100 years ago. Now these excellent exposures
of river-born deposits, exposed by quarrying, offer a unique
opportunity to view the sequence of sandstone and pebble beds and
in 2002 the old quarries were designated a Site of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a National Nature Reserve (NNR)
&amp;ndash; one of the very few NNRs designated for their geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please do not damage the rock faces, there are plenty of
loose pebbles at the foot of the cliffs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Park at the Visitor Centre Car Park (N53&amp;deg; 0.015' W2&amp;deg;
6.351') &amp;ndash; accessed via Hulme Road. Then walk to N53&amp;deg;
0.005' W2&amp;deg; 06.260' to get an overall view of the quarry
sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now walk along the path to N53&amp;deg; 0.045' W2&amp;deg; 6.202'. Look
at the rock face here to see the different beds of sandstone and
pebble stone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q1: How many layers are there?&lt;br /&gt;
Q2: Estimate the total height of the rock face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now walk along the rock face to N53&amp;deg; 0.087' W2&amp;deg; 6.223'.
If you look at the rock face here you can see diagonal lines in the
sandstone. This is called cross-bedding and indicates the direction
that the river was flowing as the higher side will be
upstream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q3: Which direction was the river flowing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk to N53&amp;deg; 0.122' W2&amp;deg; 6.259' and let your eye follow
the layers of rock along the rock face. Suddenly, you find that
there is a discontinuity. This is caused by an ancient fault, where
the beds to the west have dropped down by several metres.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Q4: What is the angle of the fault line to the
vertical?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The fault is what made further quarrying uneconomic as the
pebble beds on the east face could not be removed unless the layers
of sandstone above them were also removed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please email the answers to the above questions to me to
when you log your visit. Any logs which are not accompanied by an
email may be deleted without further warning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Just whistle while you walk II traditional cache has replaced the multi Cache J.W.W.Y.W.  GC1WQ5Z ver one. 

The reason for this was to make the cache a little easier to find. 

You are looking for a regular sized Tupperware box. 

The way to find the original cache was to whistle while you searched near to GZ. I have left the Whistle key finder in the cache and although it does not like the cold it still works just about (as tested on 19/01/2010).


**** update ***  

The battery is flat in whistle key finder so I will change it when I get chance. In the meantime just user your cachers eyes.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache is placed quite close to some houses, some of he householders are aware of the cache and appear to be ok with it.As you cross the stile it looks like someone`s garden, nice, but this is a public footpath,lets keep it public. I have changed the hint to make it a quick cache, enjoy and please do not upset the locals.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">this cache is a roadside please take care 
This is a walk I first checked out on Christmas eve,it was cold and foggy and not a muggle insight. The best way to complete this series is by walking it,there are a few roadside cache`s but parking place`s are few and the lanes not very wide.The best starting point is at Lapley Church then follow the SS Way to Mitton then onto Preston Vale you then leave the SS Way at Preston Vale cross the small bridge then pick up the lane and head towards Whiston past the pub turn left on the way to Bickford.You are now on the way back towards Lapley there are some cache`s on this lane so please be careful, they are mainly just off road, so put your boots on sharpen your pencil and good hunting.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache has been inspired by a cache we have seen before,
thanks TM. Its simple, all you have to do is play the part of a
scanning machine to reveal the cache coords.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#0033FF"&gt;&lt;b&gt;OR TAKE IT TO A
SUPERMARKET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The code used is a binary representation the UPC-A code. UPC stands
for Universal Product Code which is used in supermarkets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

COORDINATES LISTED ABOVE, BUT IT IS NEARBY!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is placed with the help of our friends over the border,
&lt;font color="green&amp;quot;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mike &amp;amp; Gail, Team
Marzipan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Inspired by their cache &lt;b&gt;Phone a
Muggle.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware, this is a &lt;font color="blue"&gt;2.5 star&lt;/font&gt;
difficulty cache It might require some time to complete. Please
&lt;b&gt;DO NOT&lt;/b&gt; attempt this cache &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;if you can't
handle failure&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cache of ours is located somewhere in the countryside &lt;i&gt;(no
need to bushwack or climb fence's)&lt;/i&gt;, but the &lt;b&gt;coordinates&lt;/b&gt;
have been hidden on a phone booth in a town in North Wales. To get
the coordinates, you must successfully reach a friendly muggle on
the other end of a public phone, and get them to read the
coordinates from a white sticker placed above their &lt;b&gt;left&lt;/b&gt;
shoulder &lt;i&gt;(high level)&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=

alt="Please Answer" width="350" height="300" align="center" border=
"3" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is some information that should help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phone is located on a busy high street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phone number&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;font color="blue" size=
"+2"&gt;01745 854315&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;last three numbers of the north and west coordinates&lt;/b&gt;
are printed on a white sticker above the phone on the LEFT hand
side high up. The rest is up to you and the muggle who answers the
phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Don't forget to log your DNF's if nobody is in!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;PS&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;i&gt;isn't it always strange when

around the &lt;font color="blue"&gt;Fruit&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=

paths, there is a small walk over some &lt;font color=

grassland in the middle of a crescent of houses. At the time of
placing the cache the area looked lovely with the blossom on the
trees and flowers in bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stealth is required.&lt;/p&gt;

The cache is placed close to the old railway line that runs from Silverdale to Newcastle. This is a pleasant flat walk.
I remember as a child standing on the bridge ( which is relatively close to the cache ) and watching the old coal trains pass and also jumping on the back getting a lift closer to town.</groundspeak:short_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This involves a short walk of about 1.5 miles (if you take the
shortest route) through the woods at Keele around the lakes near
Keele Hall. Leaflets showing trails through the woods and showing
some of the trees can be obtained by calling into 24 hours
reception (Darwin Building), the Library or Chancellors building
reception. The trails are waymarked with posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is lots of parking available if you come along outside
normal working hours, otherwise there are a few Pay and Display car
parks near the Students Union. There are a few more caches nearby
if you want to do those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about the trees and wildlife at Keele see
the &lt;a href="http://www.keele.ac.uk/university/arboretum/"&gt;Keele
Aboretum&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can get busy around here when the weather is nice. Some of
the paths can be muddy after rain so make sure you wear some good
shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache is a few metres off the path. You could get a bit
wet if you are not careful!.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Do not drive up to the cache. Parking is available at &lt;b&gt;N53 00.155
W02 16.213&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not many people realise this building is here. It also an ideal
spot to have a nosey as to any developments occuring on the new

You are looking for a small plastic box containing log, pencil and
a few swops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fancy a walk, why not try some of the other nearby
caches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
We have Motorway Mayhem, A-Road anarchy and Sidetracked, but have
you come across this series of Off Yer Trolley! caches&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Off Yer Trolley caches are intended to provide fairly easy drive-by
caches together with the opportunity to CITO in their recycling
area and nip in to do the shopping at the same time or even escape
the shopping for "The need to cache".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located a short walk away from a well known national
supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Parking is available 24 hours in the supermarket car park. You are
looking for a a small plastic container containing a log and room
for a few swaps. GPS can be a bit temperamental close to GZ.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no pen in the cache so please bring your own...&lt;br /&gt;

It can also be approached from an unclassified road from the east. Park at the end of the service road and walk the last 100 yards as this road is for service vehicles only.

The cache is a 1 ltr clip-lock box in a camo bag, so has room for swaps and TB's.

Please remember to mention the NAMES of Travel Bugs and Geocoins which you log in and out. It makes it easier to trace them if they go missing.</groundspeak:long_description>

The cache is in the vicinity of sheer cliffs - hence the terrain rating of 3 -  please supervise children and animals. Please contact me if the cache runs out of lobster tags - I will replenish. Please replace the cache very carefully, in the summer this is a very popular area for walkers. Please do not disturb the vegetation, there is no need to remove it!

The main part of the route is on well defined footpaths with short deviations off to the cache locations. Paths can be muddy after rain, and there is one steep hill near the end of the walk. Care should be taken and children supervised where the path nears the cliff edge.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is our first cache, placed to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary.  Owing to our fondness for multicaches, we have placed 4 micro caches (white film canisters) around the walk, each giving the co-ordinates to the next.  The published co-ordinates are for the first canister, once you have retrieved this you will need to examine the blue and silver notice board behind you to get the following information to find the final cache:

The number of letters on the very bottom line  =  A

The number of silver bands on the notice  =  B

First digit of the phone number (excluding STD)  =  C

Last digit minus First digit of phone number (excluding STD)  =  D

Add together the two identical digits of phone number (excluding STD)  =  E

TO AVOID NETTLES AND BRAMBLES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND MICROS, DO NOT TAKE THE FIRST (STEEP)FOOTPATH TOWARDS THE SEA, BUT CARRY ON ALONG THE MAIN PATH UNTIL YOU GET TO A GRASSY AREA.  YOU CAN THEN HEAD TO THE SEA AND GO BACK ON YOURSELF SLIGHTLY TO FIND THE SECOND MICRO.

The fourth, and final, micro cache will tell you how to use these numbers to find the main cache.

The main cache is a 1/2 litre Lock &amp; Lock box containing the usual swaps, an FTF badge and a couple quid for an ice-cream for the first to find.


Parking for this walk can be found at :

N50° 24.215    W005° 07.763

with kind permission of the property owner (and access to the footpath is to the left of the building and down the lawn, please bear in mind that this is private property and treat it accordingly).

If this car park is full, then an alternative Pay &amp; Display Car Park can be found at :

N50° 24.230    W005° 07.816

also with access down the hill to the footpath.

Once you have found the Cache, follow the path along before turning left up the hill, and then right at the path junction at the very top to return to your car.

If you are in the area, we can also recommend 'Crantock - From Garden to Cow Shed' cache by Scooby Doo and Shaggy Too, which covers an area nearer the village and can easily be done to lead on to our cache.  Please check the tide times though!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Part of my National Coastwatch Institution theme at various lookouts across the South West. This cache takes in magnificent views across St Ives Head.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The National Coastwatch Institution (NCI) is a voluntary organisation set up in 1994 to restore a visual watch along UK shores after many small Coastguard stations closed due to Government cutbacks. NCI is a registered charity and controlled by a board of Trustees with a Constitution agreed by the Charities Commission.

In 1994 when two fishermen lost their lives off the Cornish coast below a recently closed Coastguard lookout, local people decided to open and restore the visual watch. When the first station was opened at Bass Point on the Lizard, NCI was born. During the next ten years other stations followed and at the start of 2006 there were thirty operational stations keeping visual watch around the coastline of England and Wales.

NCI stations have been set up along the coast from Lands End in the South West to Hartlepool in the North East. Each station has a qualified and highly trained team to watch over its own particular area whether it is a popular seaside town, busy port or shipping area. Accidents will always happen at sea and along the coastline, wherever there is an NCI station a watchkeeper will be looking out for danger and ensuring your safety on the water.

High technology and sophisticated systems such as radar and telecommunications have vastly improved safety at sea, but there is no substitute for a watchful pair of eyes. Accidents do happen and a computer or technology cannot spot a distress flare, an overturned boat, a yacht with problems, a water sports enthusiast in difficulty, or children or adults in trouble, or possible pollution incidents. That is why the lookouts and watchkeepers are an important service provider to all those who use our coastal waters, footpaths and coastline.

AS ALWAYS with caches close to the coastline, take great care and keep dogs and children on leads. 

Parking can be found at Porthgwidden car park which is chargeable in summer months. Nice walk from beaches in St Ives.

The cache can be found about 30 feet off flat cut grass or footpath. The terrain is very uneven with pot holes in places so please take care and wear sensible shoes. As you can see from the spoiler me and the kids set it okay!

Between the NCI lookout and the ancient chapel of St Nicholas seaside in the rough. Or go via the coastpath and up from the lifebelt 

 Good spot for muggles but you would fit in sitting on the rock admiring the views while retrieving the cache!

I have raised the difficulty to 4 as people are finding it hard to find, but it is still there!

It is hidden under the grass/Moss, well hidden underneath at the back edge of a rock. It is not under any rocks!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;"Emmet" - Cornish word for ant. Now used to describe those
visiting our shores during the summer season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry the walk isn't circular but Newquay is a linear town!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to find on road parking in the roads around the first

or cycle to the first location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The original cache was muggled in April 2006, it has now
been replaced and moved to a new location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi begins at the above co-ordinates, this is location

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Having just come back from a weeks holiday in France I decided to
set this cache. 
&lt;p&gt;I have a bad habit of driving too far on my holidays,(1800 miles
in a week going to and from and around France).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of this cache is that you &lt;b&gt;"Take a Break"&lt;/b&gt;and if
this geocache encourages you to do just that.......then it's done
its job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you have a safe journey, or holiday, drive safe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Jubilee Pool is a grade II listed building built in the Art Deco style and was designed in the early 1930s by Captain F Latham. It was formally opened in May 1935 to mark King George V's Silver Jubilee. In many respects the design is unique architecturally, partly from a point of view of necessity in conforming with existing conditions of wave elements and rocks which controlled the outline. A Cubist style has been used in the interior to provide diving platforms and steps. It is Britain’s largest surviving seawater lido.

The pool was restored with the help of a retired local architect, John Clarke, who formed The Jubilee Pool Association. The JPA worked voluntarily with Penwith District Council to secure grant funding to contribute to the pool's restoration and in 1994, after essential structural works, the pool was reopened. It is now open during the summer months from 1030 to 1800 and can become very busy so stealth will be required when retrieving and replacing.

Following recent logs regarding the log being wet and the container rusting we will replace ASAP. However, in the mean time, we will accept a photo of you/your GPS the nano and the lido.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">It is believed St Piran arrived on the beach at Perran from Ireland probably in the 6th century.The oratory was probably built then of wattle and daub, as stone was not in use for building then.  The stone building, now buried beneath the sands was built at a later date and abandoned in the 10th century because of encroaching sands.  It is also known that a large graveyard lies beneath the sands.
St. Piran’s Day is celebrated on 5th March each year and is marked with parades etc. and originated as a tinners’ holiday celebrated by the tin miners of Cornwall.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">BOOKCROSSING CACHE - PLEASE ONLY LEAVE BOOKS!!


This cache has been set up as a Bookcrossing cache.  Here people can log a cache in a beautiful location (overlooking the Gannel estuary) but also, if they like, drop off or pick up books and learn about Bookcrossing.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Bookcrossing is defined as "the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise".  The term is derived from bookcrossing.com, a free on-line book club which began in order to encourage the practice, aiming to "make the whole world a library".

The 'crossing' or exchanging of books may take any of a number of forms, including wild releasing of books in public places, direct swaps, 'book rings' in which books travel in a set order to people who want to read a certain book or, in this case, by way of a geocache.  

Lots of people come to Crantock for their holiday and I thought it was a great idea to provide a place to pick up or exchange a free book to read on holiday.  I also wanted to introduce Geocachers to Bookcrossing and Bookcrossers to Geocaching!!  

Please feel free to take a book but when you get home do register the BCID number on-line at www.bookcrossing.com if it has one.  If it hasn't got a tracking number, don't worry you can still take it.  Register it yourself if you like but you don't have to!!  

If you have a book you wish to leave then please do and if you would like to keep track of your book then register it on the Bookcrossing website first.  Free downloadable labels are available on this site (I have also printed out a few and put them in the cache too if you would like to take one for later use).

Whether you are taking or leaving a book, please could you mention what the book is so that it gives an idea to other cachers what is in there currently.  You don't have to leave a book in order to take one!!  If you want to read it, just take it.  It's yours to do whatever you want with it!!

There are two suggestions for parking for quick 'cache and dash' below but if you are considering a longer walk in the area, I would suggest parking in one of the two car parks down near the beach (National Trust one is free out of season).

Please note that this cache is on the footpath and you don't need to stray from public land to find it.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The gateway to finding this cache is to not judge a book by its cover but explore its very source from within.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

This is one of a series of caches which makes a nice circular walk of about 2.7miles taking in the Trent and Mersey Canal. While doing this route, you can take in Cache GCWHH0 (Heartbreak Hill)) as well.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The route takes you from Scholar Green (parking often available at the Village Hall in Church Lane), across fields of crops in Summer, through the woods laced with bluebells in Spring. 

To start, turn right out of the car park and cross the lane, you will see the start of the public footpath a few yards ahead of you.

The cache is a small clip-lock box wrapped in a dark green plastic bag.

From this cache, head towards the the church at Church Lawton and cut across to the Canal. Find Heartbreak Hill then carry on along the canal and then take the path across the fields to the next cache (Two Troll Bridges)

You must play Pooh Sticks at this location, which our kids love doing everytime we cross the bridge. Throw a small stick over the side and see who comes out first on the other side.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Facing the bridge from inside the wood, the cache is about ten yards to the left of the track at the base of a tree with two trunks.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Gawtons Well is in the middle of a sacred grove, one of the finest examples to be found anywhere in this country.

The grove consists of many Yew trees which had used to be venerated by the Celtic people, these in turn surround a well which is fed by a water source and is known locally as Gawton’s well. The Yew trees are also circled by a stone wall, much of which is still standing.

The name Gawton’s well was derived from the hermit named Gawton who was said to have been cured of the plague at this spot, presumably from either drinking or bathing from its waters. There is also evidence of a building having stood at one time at this spot, perhaps it was a hermitage occupied by Monks attracted to the curative waters to be found at this sacred well? It is well worth a visit to this special spot as there is still an air of tranquility which pervades this unusual place.

Close by is Gawton's Stone, said to be where Gawton had been living as a hermit beneath the stone after being banished from his village, and the reason how it acquired its name.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Gandalf] gathered the huge pinecones from the branches of
his tree. Then he set one alight with bright blue fire, and threw
it whizzing down among the circle of the wolves. It struck one on
the back, and immediately his shaggy coat caught fire, and he was
leaping to and fro yelping horribly.&lt;br /&gt;
Then another came and another, one in blue flames, one in red,
another in green. They burst on the ground in the middle of the
circle and went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large
one hit the chief wolf on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten
feet, and then rushed round and round the circle biting and
snapping even at the other wolves in his anger and fright.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find Gandalf, you need to ask all the dwarves for their
numbers. Once you have done that, here's the equations to find
Gandalf:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;North&lt;/b&gt;

&amp;#8220;I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I have

&amp;#8220;A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
[...]&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;What has it got in its pocketses...?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! The Shire is in sight. You've meet all the
dwarves and Gandalf too. You've had an audience with Bard, the new
master of Dale, and Thrandui, the Elven King in Mirkwood. You've
even been to see Smaug! Now it is time to return to the nicely
manicured lawns of the Shire, and well done to you!&lt;/p&gt;
To find Bilbo, you need to find Smaug and Gandalf, each of whom
have a piece of the puzzle. Once you have done that, here's the
equation to find Bilbo:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;North&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3eb208d0-a49e-4cb6-a09f-f87c26c00ac0"&gt;

"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=468b1b0b-d36c-4dc6-8861-484d0c6bf980"&gt;
GC2CA4V Ask Smaug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to find &lt;b&gt;Gandalf&lt;/b&gt; you will need to ask all 13 Dwarves
in the Eccleshall Ring. In order to find &lt;b&gt;Smaug&lt;/b&gt; you will need
to ask Bard and the Elven King of Mirkwood (Thranduil). See the
listings for Gandalf and Smaug for more details.
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty rating is based on you needing to find 17 other
caches in order to get the coordinates for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

base of operations for the three caches in this series. If you
choose not to be a customer of the hostelry, please park elsewhere
- there are several easy-to-find places nearby.&lt;br /&gt;
The path to Bard's treasure can get boggy at times of rainfall.
Consider your footware carefully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Bard] bent his bow for the last time. Suddenly out of the
dark something fluttered to his shoulder. He started, but it was
only an old thrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it brought
him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for
he was of the race of Dale.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Wait! Wait!&amp;rdquo; it said to him. &amp;ldquo;The moon is
rising. Look for the hollow of the left breast as he flies and
turns above you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this cache you need to visit lake town of Esgaroth (well...
kind of) and perform two calculations. This will give you the
coordinates of Bard's small treasure (cache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waypoint 1: Entrance to Mirkwood: there is a rather unfriendly
notice warning visitors to avoid stealing fish. Count the words and
letters to answer some questions.
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A=number of letters in the first word&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B=number of letters in the third word, but subtract one in
honour of the old thrush who helped Bard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C=number of times the letter 'I' appears in the whole

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waypoint 2: E=count the planks that make up the platform that
is the lake town of Esgaroth. E is half this number, rounding down
to the nearest whole number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bard's treasure is at:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;North&lt;/b&gt; 52º51.ABE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;West&lt;/b&gt; 002º17.CED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ask Bard: W&lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=538966bd-7b47-4504-852e-06741692f911"&gt;here
is Bilbo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bard doesn't know where Bilbo is, but his best guess is that you
should look for &lt;b&gt;Smaug&lt;/b&gt; the dragon - he is bound to know more.
Thus look in Bard's cache for the &lt;b&gt;north&lt;/b&gt; coordinates for
&lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC2CA4V"&gt;GC2CA4V - Smaug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Elven King looked at Bilbo with a new wonder.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Bilbo Baggins!&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;You are more worthy to
wear the armour of Elf- Princes than many that have looked more
comely in it. But I wonder if Thorin Oakenshield will see it
so.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thranduil, the Elven King of Mirkwood, was a simple soul -
suspicious in nature but quick to re-align his loyalties when
circumstances dictated that the enemy or a greater enemy should be
treated as an ally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thus this cache is a simple find, as long as you avoid touching the
waters of the woods, and as long as giant spiders don't get
you!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ask Thranduil: W&lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=538966bd-7b47-4504-852e-06741692f911"&gt;here
is Bilbo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thranduil doesn't know where Bilbo is, but his best guess is that
you should look for &lt;b&gt;Smaug&lt;/b&gt; the dragon - he is bound to know
where to look for that burgler! Thus look in Thranduil's cache for
the &lt;b&gt;west&lt;/b&gt; coordinates for &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=468b1b0b-d36c-4dc6-8861-484d0c6bf980"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;GC2CA4V - Smaug&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Smaug is a short walk away, so

to complete two other caches first, in order to work out the
coordinates for Smaug. The posted cCoordinates are for a nearby

line of busines nearby. The actual cache location is within 300m of
these coordinates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smaug! There he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep;
thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but
his fires were low in slumber. Beneath him, under all his limbs and
his huge coiled tail, and about him on all sides stretching away
across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious things,
gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained
in the ruddy light.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find Smaug, you need to ask Bard and the Elven King
Thranduil. Once you have done that, here's the equations to find
Smaug:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;North:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=

GC2CA2R Ask Thranduil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We recommend that you complete the other caches in the order listed
above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask Smaug: W&lt;a href=

is Bilbo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You thought this was the end of it...? Smaug contains the
&lt;b&gt;west&lt;/b&gt; coordinates for Bilbo, another cache near to
Eccleshall. Trust a dragon to choose not to tell you an important
detail like that...&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled dark spots. ‘Crack!’ It had caught a snail and was knocking it on the stone. ‘Crack! Crack!’

Cache is close to a path connecting streets, a popular dog-walk area (with dog bins provided if you've got your hound with you). 

Easily accessible by road too or on foot and also a wheelchair accessible area though grass is long off the paths.

Small plastic container, log, pencil, few small items. 

FTF may have the little VW if you like.

No need to go near the church - close to a black engineering-brick wall.

We spent over an hour last night checking the entire area with a cache nowhere to been seen.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The Britannia Stadium is a football stadium in Stoke-on-Trent, England. It is the home of the mighty Stoke City Football Club who gained promotion to the Premier League in 2008.

The stadium holds 28,383 supporters, with the highest attendance being recorded for the sell-out fixture against Everton in their FA Cup 3rd Round tie in 2002. 

The listed co-ordinates will take you to the “Wall of Fame” which consists of Bricks purchased by keen supporters when the stadium first opened in 1997 following the club’s move from the nearby Victoria Ground.

Whilst facing the Wall of Fame, go in 12 bricks in from the left and 7 up from the bottom to locate a particular brick. (Hint : Check the name of this cache if you want to be certain that you’ve located the correct brick)

The number of letters on this particular brick = X


Take a few steps back and examine the main entrance to the stadium. You will see a large club crest denoting the club nickname and the year the club was formed : 1Y63


Your final mission is to take a short, leisurely stroll around the outside perimeter of the stadium. You will come across an impressive statue commemorating an all-time Stoke City legend.


How many ‘Stans’ are featured in this statue? : Z

Once you have identified X, Y &amp; Z, the following co-ordinates will take you to Cara’s cache

N 52 5(Z+6).1(X-6)9 / W 002 10.Y12




This cache is 9cm x 9cm tupperware box painted black inside a zipseal bag. It contains a few small swaps, a log book and for the first-to-find a Mapamundi Geocoin. 

Please note that the cache is located near to water so great care should be taken if you are accompanied by junior cachers.

Car Parking is not easily available around the Stadium - there are spaces outside the Club Shop which is open Monday to Friday, however it may be worth checking if you can park here. As such this is not a ‘cache and dash’ and you may have to park some distance from the Stadium and walk for a while.

It’s probably also worth noting that match days should be avoided when looking for this cache as there will be hundreds of muggles milling about!!</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="green"&gt;Well we thought it was about time that cachers
could look for a cache which is buried.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font color="green"&gt;There in no need to take a spade or a shovel
for this one though, as it should be easy enough to obtain without
these. Please make sure you place it back as you found it and that
you don't give any clues away in your log!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The epicness of the cache is astounding. It tortured my brain until the moment I could feast my eyes upon the luscious bounty. Hidden deep in a black cavern, being house and sheltered by such a large container but being so fragile and tiny in actual size.

Never have I seen such wonders or amazement in front of my naive little eyes.













(Only joking, didn't take too long to find but gave us a chuckle.)
(PS, don't write boring logs or you'll have your eyes gauged by a blunt spoon.)







(PPS, this has turned into rather the long log.)










(PPPS, Maybe I should just keep writing?)

Shep is my border collie and on a Sunday we walk a loop which he loves. You will need a lead for your dog and obviously a few "poop bags".
Parking for doing the loop is at the pub on "New in Lane" Trentham.
Waypoint for the pub car park is N 52° 58.239' W 002° 11.440
From the car park cross the road and head into Pacific Road. You will see on the right side of Pacific road an embankment with a tarmac path leading up it. Go this way.
The tarmac path takes you to the Trent and Mersey canal where the first cache is hidden. I think this one is quite a difficult one to spot but my wife says its easy. You decide.


Watch out for people walking along the towpath and use stealth.</groundspeak:long_description>

This cache is another nano and I apologise for that. I hate nano's myself but needed this one placing here to keep you on the correct route. You will need a pen/pencil.
When you've done this one put your dog on the lead as you will hit some pavements near a busy road for my next cache.
Note that you can do another cache called "stuck on trent" on the way to my next hide. When you're signing the logbook to "stuck on trent" you will see over the bridge to the path that you should be on to get to my next cache. Leave "stuck on trent" and start to walk back from where you came and you will see to your left a metal entrance that leads down to the path that you now need.

Co-ords for "Stuck on trent" are N 52° 59.381 W 002° 11.170

This cache is a camouflaged tube hidden I think quite well although the wife says its easy.
Its at this point that shep goes back on the lead as you will approach roads after you've found this cache.
Keep an eye out for cyclists and walkers.

After finding this cache walk to the end of the path. You will now see handford roundabout in front of you. Stay on the pavement and bear left. You will see a Indian restraunt with a car park.
Behind the Indian restraunt you will see a dirt track road leading to a grassy fielded area. Go that way to cache no9.</groundspeak:long_description>

PLEASE NOTE.. There are loads of kids who play around the area so PLEASE USE STEALTH when looking for this cache.


Welcome to Sheps walk. This is cache number 9 out of 11

Its normally at this stage of sheps walk that we both need a rest so we sit here for 10 minutes and get our breath back.

Its a camouflaged tube containing a logbook only so you will need a pen/pencil to log in.
Keep an eye out for kids playing and dog walkers.

When you've found this cache you will need to go directly up the hill to the houses with fences on the back of them. Go to the left and you will see an entry in between the houses that takes onto Diarmid road. Once on Diarmid road go left and you will reach church lane. Turn right on Church lane and head up the hill and you will see Wilson road on your left that leads to Primrose hill and the next cache location.</groundspeak:long_description>

We found the lid, camo and could seen bits of the cache mashed around the tree where the cache should of been, we're pretty sure we know the place that it was hidden originally too, but sadly this has been set on fire by the local muggles (stay classy!). We've brought those bits and pieces home with us, but the cache now needs to be replaced (as the owner has already said).

I think perhaps the other group of trees in the area would be a safer bet.

Thanks for the cache anyway! We really enjoyed the series!</groundspeak:text>

This cache is a small sized tupperware click lock box containing a few swaps for the kids. Or even you big kids I suppose. Keep an eye out for dog walkers.

After finding this no10 cache follow your gps along the path to the no11 cache heading.
This path leads you down and onto the rugby club playing fields but don't worry as the footpath crosses between the two rugby pitches. Head between the two pitches on towards the club house and up the road to the left of the club house which brings you back onto "new in lane". If you have kids with you then to the right of the club house is a park area with swings, climbing frames etc for the kids to play on while you take a break.
